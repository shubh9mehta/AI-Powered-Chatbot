In this document, research data sharing is limited to sharing for reuse via deposit into one or more data repository(ies). Commonly, this is done to meet funder or publisher requirements or to extend open research practices. Ideally, this guidance is considered during the proposal development process. When used during the planning phases, specifically to support the creation of Data Management and Sharing Plans (DMSP), researchers will be better prepared to meet funder obligations and manage data for sharing as planned.\n\n[Definitions](#definitions)\n\n<Accordion>\n\n  <AccordionPanel header=\"Use Case: Research involving people\" level=\"4\">\n\n  ##### Description\n  \n  This use case includes projects involving human research participants and data generated by or about them as determined by the IU Human Research Protection Program (HRPP). \n\n  ##### Criteria for sharing\n\n  The existing data or research agreement(s) (e.g., DUA, DSA, collaborative agreement) allows you to share the data.\n\n  Human research participants consented to sharing data beyond the original study. \n\n  The data files do not contain any protected elements (e.g., date of birth, social security number, etc.) or other sensitive information that are associated with special requirements to safeguard the data. \n  \n  ##### Considerations/Decision Points\n\n  What do you want/are required to do with the data during the project? \n\n  What do you want/are required to do with the data after the project is complete? \n\n  Can the data set to be shared be provided via open access?

While workflows and processes will vary across repositories, generally speaking, researchers submit and describe their own data which is then ingested into the repository for storage. Other researchers can then download, or request to download, the data directly from the repository. (Source: [https://www.nnlm.gov/guides/data-glossary/repository](https://www.nnlm.gov/guides/data-glossary/repository))  \n- **Research data sharing** (for reuse): Providing data to individuals not associated with the project that generated the data, typically for reuse for research purposes.  \n- **Disclosure risk**: The risk of inappropriate attribution of information to an individual or organization without their approval. \n- **Open access sharing**: Making data available to anyone for access and reuse; often includes redistribution.  \n- **Open data**: Open data and content can be freely used, modified, and shared by anyone for any purpose. (Source: [https://opendefinition.org/od/2.1/en/](https://opendefinition.org/od/2.1/en/))  \n- **Limited data set** (Defined under HIPAA): A limited data set is described as health information that excludes certain, listed direct identifiers (see below) but that may include city; state; ZIP Code; elements of date; and other numbers, characteristics, or codes not listed as direct identifiers. The direct identifiers listed in the Privacy Rule's limited data set provisions apply both to information about the individual and to information about the individual's relatives, employers, or household members.

        "content": "A [Federal Statistical Research Data Center](https://www.census.gov/fsrdc) facility is coming to the Indiana University Bloomington campus.\n\nFederal Statistical Research Data Centers, formerly known as Census Research Data Centers, are U.S. Census Bureau facilities that provide researchers with local access to highly restricted data from a range of federal agencies such as the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the National Center for Health Statistics. There are currently 29 Federal Statistical Research Data Centers throughout the United States.\n\nDue to concerns about privacy and confidentiality, federal agencies limit the data they make publicly available by removing geographic identifiers (like county or zip code) or making alterations the data before public release. Federal Statistical Research Data Centers provide access to more detailed, micro-level data, letting researchers use the granular data while protecting confidentiality.\n\nThe new facility will be an important asset for the Bloomington campus supporting social science research, according to Jeff Zaleski, IU Bloomington’s interim vice provost for research.\n\n\"The Bloomington campus is home to leading researchers in the social and health sciences, public policy, and business,\" said Zaleski. \"This facility will provide new, multidisciplinary opportunities for our researchers to generate new insights on important social issues.\"\n\nResearchers working in IU research priority areas—including precision health and the addictions crisis—will be able to leverage the federal data to study the role of social contexts such as food insecurity and healthcare access.\n\nInterested researchers can attend an informational webinar on Friday, September 25, 2020.\n\n“Harmonizing county-level data from the Research Data Center and IU’s Person to Person Health Interview Study will provide unique insights into geographical variation in social status and resources that contribute to health disparities and the overall burden of disease in Indiana,” said Brea Perry, associate vice provost for social sciences at IU Bloomington and professor of sociology in the College of Arts and Sciences. The [Person to Person Health Interview study](https://precisionhealth.iu.edu/get-involved/person-to-person.html) is canvassing thousands of Hoosiers to gather information linking genetics with social and physical environments to better understand the physical and mental health of Indiana residents.\n\nKelley School of Business professor [Carlos Avenancio-León](https://www.avenancioleon.com/), whose research has used RDC data, said the data center on campus will not only provide important opportunities for research, but draw new researchers.\n\n\"Having an RDC is essential for building a complete picture of big questions in business and economics,\" said Avenancio-Leon. \"In my own work, thanks to Census data, I have been able to evaluate and quantify the effects that granting voting rights to minorities has had on their economic well-being, and zoom in on the mechanisms that drive the relationship between political and economic empowerment. Having an RDC on campus will help social scientists and other researchers further their research agendas and help the campus attract new talent.\"\n\nConstruction of the Federal Research Data Center at IU Bloomington is projected to begin in late 2021. Kosali Simon, who also draws on RDCs in her research, emphasized that it’s not too soon for IU researchers to start planning research projects using the RDC.\n\n\"Bloomington researchers are in the perfect position to get started planning now, so we’re ready to hit the ground running when our RDC opens,\" said [Simon, who is associate vice provost for health sciences at IU Bloomington and Class of 1948 Herman B. Wells Endowed professor in the top-ranked O’Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs](https://news.iu.edu/iu-experts/profile/m/814/simon-kosali). \"This timeline allows researchers to start now on forming research proposals, seeking seed funding, and building teams for larger endeavors, like the sort of multidisciplinary research in the social and health sciences that is possible with this wealth of data.\"\n\nIn the meantime, IU Bloomington researchers will [continue to have access to the Kentucky Research Data Center in Lexington, Kentucky](https://news.iu.edu/stories/2017/09/iub/inside/18-research-data-center.html), through the campus’s membership in the Kentucky Research Data Center consortium. The consortium also includes the University of Kentucky, Ohio State University, and the University of Louisville. Bloomington’s new facility will be a branch of the KRDC facility in Lexington.\n\nAs of July 2020, the KRDC is again open for research, with extra restrictions and precautions in place due to COVID-19. IU’s [Social Science Research Commons](https://ssrc.indiana.edu/), which serves as liaison to the KRDC Consortium, can assist researchers with travel costs for use of the Lexington facility.\n\nContact the Social Science Research Commons at [ssrc@indiana.edu](mailto:ssrc@indiana.edu) for more information.",

The first will center around creating web-based tools that allow research teams to discover what data sets are available, where they might be applicable and what internal or external compliance measures might be required for access. The second key area will be to provide centralized infrastructure to house, search and serve the data. More information will be shared as the data commons is created.\n\n\"This enhancement of research infrastructure empowers our scholarly community to discover and access new research inputs, fostering more insightful scholarship, robustly equipping our students and elevating IU’s contributions to public service,\" said [Kosali Simon](https://oneill.indiana.edu/faculty-research/directory/profiles/faculty/full-time/simon-kosali.html), chair of the IU Research Data Commons Taskforce and Distinguished Professor, Herman B Wells Endowed Professor and Paul O’Neill Chair in the O’Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs. \"The data commons will encourage collaboration through shared data made easier to access and will reduce wasteful re-purchasing of existing licenses.\"\n\nData assets and services will be made available for research teams to use as input into their workflows as well as services to help curate and disseminate data products that result from cutting-edge research. The IU Research Data Commons will also help researchers comply with new federal research requirements efficiently while extending utility of datasets; expand the impact of a research team’s output and allow researchers to seek out existing data sets to test out new theories or generate new discoveries.\n\nAn executive group comprised of research and services leaders from IU and an oversight committee of faculty will oversee the commons. The data commons will be funded by IU Research, with support by IU Libraries and University Information Technology Services (UITS).\n\n\"This is an important opportunity for Libraries. For centuries we have made information collections discoverable, accessible and preserved them for future use.  Research data should be treated with as much care as any other collections to enable the acceleration and advancement of transformational knowledge,\" said IU Libraries Dean [Diane Dallis-Comentale](https://libraries.indiana.edu/diane-dallis-comentale). \"Libraries in Bloomington and Indianapolis are an essential part of the incredible team of service providers and experts who comprise the IU Research Data Commons.\"\n\n\"UITS is delighted to be part of this collaborative effort that leverages IU’s strengths in information and technology services,\" said [Rob Lowden](https://itnews.iu.edu/people/rlowden.php), Vice President for Information Technology and Chief Information Officer at IU. \"Together with Libraries and Research, we will provide centralized infrastructure to house, search and serve the data and contribute to open science. This investment will also enable IU teams to compete for large external grants both for research and for further enhancing this infrastructure.\"",

This objective embodies a collective recognition of the importance of a university-wide resource for discovering, sharing, and accessing data resources across the IU community. Such an initiative would build on our world-class strengths in centralized cyberinfrastructure and other areas to present researchers with more integrated and easy-to-access resources; enable richer training opportunities for students and faculty; and empower IU to better serve local organizations, our state, and other partners. This is an ambitious goal, but a lot of work has been undertaken by working groups at individual campuses and units already.  \n  \nAs a first step, this working group is tasked with collecting input from faculty, students and others on a vision for the Research Data Commons and the practical steps for achieving it in the near-, medium- and long-term. The working group will be soliciting your feedback through an open town hall webinar on May 23 at 1p.m.  \n  \nWe will also administer [a brief survey](https://iu.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0v91F85i6bJOjqK) to learn how a more coordinated approach to research data could help researchers in their day-to-day activities (for example, what processes could be simplified). The group is also tasked with identifying useful models and best practices from other universities, and possible funding sources through, for example, NSF data hub grants, so that IU’s activities in this area will be financially sustainable in the long run. The working group also appreciates feedback on scope, access, governance, funding, staffing, outreach, training, maintenance, and anything else we consider important towards a research data commons. From feedback received, the working group will develop a preliminary report and submit to VPR by June 30, 2022.  \n  \nThe group consists of 12 members; please feel free to reach out to us individually at any time, and/or provide input through the survey or townhall meeting.  \n  \nKosali Simon (CHAIR)  \nDistinguished Professor, Herman B Wells Endowed Professor, O’Neill Chair  \nO’Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs  \nAssociate Vice Provost for Health Sciences  \n  \nDiane Dallis-Comentale  \nRuth Lilly Dean, University Libraries  \n  \nShiaofen Fang  \nProfessor and Chair, Computer and Information Science, IUPUI School of Science  \n  \nKun Huang  \nProfessor, Biostatistics and Health Data, IU School of Medicine  \nAssociate Director of Data Science, IU Simon Comprehensive Cancer Center  \n  \nMatthew Link  \nAssociate Vice President, Research Technologies, University Information Technology Services  \n  \nGerardo Maupomé  \nProfessor, Global Health  \nAssociate Dean of Research, IUPUI Fairbanks School of Public Health  \n  \nFilippo Menczer  \nLuddy Distinguished Professor of Informatics and Computer Science; Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering  \nDirector, Observatory on Social Media  \n  \nAaron Neal\nAssociate Vice President, Enterprise Systems, University Information Technology Services  \n  \nBrea Perry\nProfessor, Sociology, College of Arts & Sciences, IUB  \nAssociate Vice Provost for Social Sciences, IUB  \n  \nBeth Plale\nMichael A. and Lauren Burns McRobbie Bicentennial Professor of Computer Engineering; Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering  \nPervasive Technology Institute, Office of Vice President for Information Technology  \n\nAngie Raymond\nAssociate Professor of Business Law and Ethics, Kelley School of Business  \nDirector, Program on Data Management and Information Governance, Ostrom Workshop\n\nSarah Wiehe\nAssociate Professor of Pediatrics and Associate Dean of Community & Translational Research  \nCo-Director, Indiana Clinical and Translational Science Institute",

        "content": "## Human Subjects\nIf your research involves human subjects, or is regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), it requires review and approval from an institutional review board (IRB) or the Human Subjects Office. Visit the <CatalogPill type=\"RC\" href=\"\">[Using human subjects in your research](https://researchdata.iu.edu/resource-catalog/using-human-subjects-in-research/)</CatalogPill> webpage to review a list of guiding questions that will help you to determine if your proposal needs to be submitted to the IRB.\n  \n\n## Animal Subjects\nIf your study involves animal research or testing, it must be thoroughly reviewed by a committee before your work can begin to ensure humane animal care and use. The principal investigator is responsible for submitting a protocol application for review and approval. The specific requirements and procedures will vary depending on your research activity. Review the IU Research <CatalogPill type=\"RC\" href=\"\">[Procedures for all studies involving live vertebrate animals](https://researchdata.iu.edu/resource-catalog/iu-research-animal-care-use/)</CatalogPill> webpage for more information about the submission and review process.\n  \n\n## Biological Materials\nAll research activities at Indiana University involving recombinant DNA (rDNA) or synthetic nucleic acid molecules, and some non-recombinant biological materials, must go through a review process before work can begin.\n  \n\nIU’s Institutional Biosafety Committees (IBC) and the IU Environmental Health and Safety Office’s Biological Safety Program review each protocol to ensure research is conducted with attention to the safety of laboratory personnel, the environment in which the research is conducted, and the community at large.\n  \n\nPlease visit the <CatalogPill type=\"RC\" href=\"\">[Institutional Biosafety Committee](https://researchdata.iu.edu/resource-catalog/institutional-biosafety-committee/)</CatalogPill> webpage for additional information, including what needs to be reviewed by the IBC and the submission and renewal process.\n\n## How do I know what level of review is needed?\n  \n\n\n## Human Subjects\nIf your proposal will require IRB approval, there are three levels of review - exempt, expedited, and full board. Additional information about each of the levels of review and the types of studies that fall into different categories can be found on the <CatalogPill type=\"RC\" href=\"/resource-catalog/submitting-new-study-for-review\">Submitting a new study for review webpage</CatalogPill>.\n  \n\nIf your project involves no more than minimal risk, and meets the criteria specified in the IU <CatalogPill type=\"RC\" href=\"/resource-catalog/hrpp-policy-exempt\">HRPP Policy regarding Exempt Research</CatalogPill>, it is eligible for review under the “Exempt” review process. “Minimal risk” means that the person participating in your study would experience no more risk than they would throughout the course of a normal day or during routine physical exams or psychological tests. “Exempt” review means review by one IRB or Human Subjects Office staff member, sometimes in consultation with others.\n  \n\nIf your project is minimal risk, but not eligible for exempt review, it may be eligible for “Expedited” review. Research may qualify for expedited review if it involves only minimal risk and all study procedures fall within one or more of the expedited categories listed in federal regulations, as detailed under <CatalogPill type=\"RC\" href=\"/resource-catalog/hrpp-policy-expedited-review\">IU HRPP Policy on IRB Review Process, section 2.5</CatalogPill>. “Expedited” review means review by one or more experienced IRB reviewers.\n  \n\nA full board review is required for research that is not eligible for an exempt or expedited review, either because it is greater than minimal risk or because the study procedures are outside the exempt and expedited categories. “Full board review” means review by the full Institutional Review Board, which is composed of at least five members with a range of expertise.\n  \n\nThe <CatalogPill type=\"RC\" href=\"/resource-catalog/iu-research-irb-protocol-decision-tree\">Protocol Decision Tree</CatalogPill> can help you determine what level of review will be needed. Please keep in mind that this tool is intended to be used as guidance. Ultimately, the Human Research Protection Program (HRPP) staff will determine the level of review needed based on the information available when the study is submitted.\n  \n\n## Animal Subjects\nFor studies involving the use of animals, the review committee has the option to request a full committee review or allow the protocol to be reviewed by a designated committee member (or members). All protocols remain active for three years. At the end of that period, a new protocol application must be completed and submitted. For additional information on this process and related requirements, please visit the Animal Care & Use <CatalogPill type=\"RC\" href=\"/resource-catalog/protocol-reviews-renewals\">Protocol Reviews and Renewals</CatalogPill> webpage.",

Specifically, the form should include sufficient detail about the research, and should not just provide lists of isolated facts. \n- The informed consent form cannot contain any language through which the subject (or LAR) waives or appears to waive legal rights, or that releases (or appears to release) researchers, research sponsors, the institution, or others from legal liability for negligence.\n\nFor complete policy information regarding informed consent, please review the <CatalogPill type=\"RC\" href=\"/resource-catalog/informed-consent\">HRPP Policy - Informed Consent</CatalogPill>.\n\n## Can I get a waiver?\nIn some circumstances, IRB may grant a waiver of the requirement of informed consent, and/or approve modifications to the informed consent requirement. Some of the specific criteria that researchers must meet to be granted a waiver or be approved to make modifications include:\n- The research must involve no more than minimal risk to the subjects.\n- The research could not practicably be carried out without the waiver or alteration.\n- The waiver or modification must not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the subjects.\n- Whenever appropriate, the subjects (or LARs) should be provided with additional relevant information after participation.          \n\nFor full details regarding informed consent and obtaining waivers, please review Section 2.2 Waiver or Alteration of Informed Consent of the <CatalogPill type=\"RC\" href=\"/resource-catalog/informed-consent\">HRPP Policy - Informed Consent</CatalogPill> policy.",

Working with ORA will ensure you are complying with university and/or funding policies. See below for frequently asked questions about working with ORA.\n\nMany of the answers to these questions will ultimately be determined on a case by case basis, so the answers below serve as guidance, but your best resource for the final answers is to contact the Office for Research Administration. This applies to faculty, staff, graduate students, and undergraduate students. If you are using university resources to conduct your research, and there are related conditions, you should contact the Office for Research Administration to help answer your questions.\n<div class=\"rvt-p-tb-xxs\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<Accordion>\n    <AccordionPanel header=\"Why would I need to sign a non-monetary agreement for data?\">\n    Most data comes with terms around its use, including how the data can or can’t be used, as well as requirements for protecting the data that is going to be received or accessed. Agreements typically detail these requirements and ask for the data user to confirm they will comply. This type of agreement is usually between institutions or entities, not individuals. This is why you will need a representative from the <CatalogPill type=\"RC\" href=\"/resource-catalog/iu-research-office-for-research-administration/\">Office for Research Administration (ORA)</CatalogPill> to sign the agreement on behalf of Indiana University. To begin this process, fill out the <CatalogPill type=\"RC\" href=\"/resource-catalog/ora-contract-request-form/\">ORA Contract Request Form</CatalogPill>. If you are accessing the data for a formal role that you play at IU, using it for something that has to do with your work, utilizing university resources or infrastructure, receiving compensation of any kind from the university, and/or if you are a student who is working on a sponsored project in a faculty member’s lab, then the institution enters the agreement on your behalf, which is why you need an official representative to sign the agreement.\n    </AccordionPanel>\n    <AccordionPanel header=\"What can I sign or agree to on my own behalf? What must I submit to ORA?\">\n    This depends on how the provider of the data is set-up. Sometimes an agreement will require that the PI signs the agreement, while other times they are looking for an institutional acknowledgement. It will also depend on who the agreement puts the responsibility on to adhere to the terms. For example, if you are utilizing the data in an official capacity as a faculty member or graduate student at IU, and using IU resources, facilities, and/or equipment, then IU has a stake in those terms. This is why it is best for the <CatalogPill type=\"RC\" href=\"/resource-catalog/iu-research-office-for-research-administration/\">Office for Research Administration (ORA)</CatalogPill> to review the agreement to ensure the correct person signs it. To submit an agreement to be reviewed by ORA, fill out the <CatalogPill type=\"RC\" href=\"/resource-catalog/ora-contract-request-form/\">ORA Contract Request Form</CatalogPill>.\n    </AccordionPanel>\n    <AccordionPanel header=\"Does IU need to review a “terms of service” agreement for me to download data?\">\n    Yes, if you are going to download data to IU infrastructure, then IU needs to review the agreement first to ensure that you are meeting the expectations in the terms of service. For example, if you are downloading data, IU needs to ensure that you are meeting requirements regarding where the data is placed when it is downloaded. Even if it is not a formal agreement, someone from the <CatalogPill type=\"RC\" href=\"/resource-catalog/iu-research-office-for-research-administration/\">Office for Research Administration (ORA)</CatalogPill> can read through the terms to see if there are questions or concerns and help you work through processes. To submit an agreement to ORA for review, fill out the <CatalogPill type=\"RC\" href=\"/resource-catalog/ora-contract-request-form/\">ORA Contract Request Form</CatalogPill>.\n    </AccordionPanel>\n    <AccordionPanel header=\"I found a data registry that allows me to download data, but I have to agree to terms of service. Can I sign these terms, or should I submit this to ORA?\">\n    If you find a data registry that allows you to download data, but have to agree to terms of service it is still recommended that you submit the terms of service to the <CatalogPill type=\"RC\" href=\"/resource-catalog/iu-research-office-for-research-administration/\">Office for Research Administration (ORA)</CatalogPill> first. Submit the terms of service using the <CatalogPill type=\"RC\" href=\"/resource-catalog/ora-contract-request-form/\">ORA Contract Request Form</CatalogPill>. You may ultimately be able to sign it yourself, but by having ORA review it first, they can help walk you through the agreement, help you to understand all the requirements and/or point you in the direction of resources needed to meet those requirements.\n    </AccordionPanel>\n    <AccordionPanel header=\"I was asked to sign a non-disclosure agreement as a part of receiving access to some data.

If you need to sign an NDA not related to data for research purposes, it still needs to be signed by an official representative from the university, but it will be through a different department, which will depend on the nature of the agreement.\n    </AccordionPanel>\n    <AccordionPanel header=\"I need to sign a data use agreement to receive access to some data. Can I do this?\">\n    Before signing a data use agreement, you should go through the <CatalogPill type=\"RC\" href=\"/resource-catalog/iu-research-office-for-research-administration/\">Office for Research Administration (ORA)</CatalogPill>. Ultimately, who signs the agreement will be determined on a case by case basis. There are several factors that determine who ultimately signs the agreement. This will depend on how the agreement is set up and the entity that owns the data tends to make the decisions as to whether a PI or institutional entity signs the agreement to certify the use and term. This is because institutions have formal infrastructure in place, such as secure servers, that are equipped to handle sensitive information. ORA can provide guidance based on the agreement as to whom should sign the agreement. Submit the data use agreement using the  <CatalogPill type=\"RC\" href=\"/resource-catalog/ora-contract-request-form/\">ORA Contract Request Form</CatalogPill>. \n\n    </AccordionPanel>\n    <AccordionPanel header=\"Do I need an agreement to share or receive data?\">\n    This will depend on the type of data you intend to share, what regulations govern that data, and if the provider of the data is requiring an agreement. From IU’s perspective, there are some regulations that require an agreement. These are usually around human subjects data and require the user to attest that they will not try to identify participants in a de-identified dataset. There may also be other stipulations in place such as whether the data can be shared. All of this will depend on where the data came from and the rules and policies put in place by that entity.\n\n    Even if an agreement is not required, it is generally a best practice to put a data use agreement in place. This is especially true if you are the provider for the data and want to put rules into place in regards to whether the data can be shared, how the data can be utilized, or if you want to review publications that come out as a result of the use of your data or want to be acknowledged for providing the data.\n\n    Whether you are receiving data or are the owner of the data and wish to share it, it is generally best to go through the <CatalogPill type=\"RC\" href=\"/resource-catalog/iu-research-office-for-research-administration/\">Office for Research Administration (ORA)</CatalogPill> first to determine if a data use agreement is needed. You can initiate this process by filling out the <CatalogPill type=\"RC\" href=\"/resource-catalog/ora-contract-request-form/\">ORA Contract Request Form</CatalogPill>.\n \n    </AccordionPanel>\n    <AccordionPanel header=\"If I find free data on the internet that doesn’t require terms of service and is available do I need to submit to ORA?\">\n    If there are absolutely no restrictions to the data at all and you are not attesting that you will use you or protect the data in a certain way, then you do not need submit anything to the <CatalogPill type=\"RC\" href=\"/resource-catalog/iu-research-office-for-research-administration/\">Office for Research Administration (ORA)</CatalogPill>. If you are using university resources to conduct your research, then you are responsible for following the rules and adhering to any policies there may be.

The best option will depend on the size of your files, level of security needed, and whether you other people on your team to also need to have access.\n\nFirst, critical to understanding what type of data storage is appropriate for your needs, is understanding the data classification. By default, research data are considered restricted data, though there may be some instances in which your data is not restricted. You can use the <CatalogPill type=\"RC\" href=\"/resource-catalog/udmc-data-sharing-handling\">Data Sharing and Handling Tool</CatalogPill> to understand which storage options are available based on the level of security that your data needs.\n\nOnce you know the classification of your data, you can use the <CatalogPill type=\"RC\" href=\"/resource-catalog/data-storage-finder\">Data Storage Finder</CatalogPill> tool to evaluate and compare available storage options that will fit your needs.\n  \n\nMajor options for data storage available to IU researchers include: \n- <CatalogPill type=\"RC\" href=\"/resource-catalog/home-directory-space\">Home directory space</CatalogPill>: Home directory space is intended for low-capacity, low-performance uses, such as storing documentation, configuration files, source files, and data files needed to run batch and/or interactive jobs on IU's <CatalogPill type=\"RC\" href=\"/resource-catalog/supercomputers-for-academic-research-at-iu\">Research Supercomputers</CatalogPill>.\n- <CatalogPill type=\"RC\" href=\"/resource-catalog/uits-research-technologies-storage-service-slate\">Slate</CatalogPill>: Slate is a centralized, high performance Lustre file system designed for the persistent storage of scholarly data to meet the needs of data-intensive workflows and analytics running on Indiana University's <CatalogPill type=\"RC\" href=\"/resource-catalog/supercomputers-for-academic-research-at-iu\">Research Supercomputers</CatalogPill>. Space on Slate is not subject to a purge policy. However, data are not backed up by Research Technologies or any other entity in UITS.\n- <CatalogPill type=\"RC\" href=\"/resource-catalog/uits-research-technologies-storage-service-slate-project\">Slate-Project:</CatalogPill> The Slate-Project high performance file system is a centralized storage environment supporting extreme, data-intensive, performance-demanding (Big Data) workflows running on Indiana University's <CatalogPill type=\"RC\" href=\"/resource-catalog/supercomputers-for-academic-research-at-iu\">Research Supercomputers</CatalogPill>.\n- <CatalogPill type=\"RC\" href=\"/resource-catalog/slate-scratch\">Slate-Scratch</CatalogPill>: Slate-Scratch is a large-capacity, high-throughput, high-bandwidth Lustre-based file system designed for the temporary storage of computational data to meet the needs of data-intensive workflows and analytics running on Indiana University's <CatalogPill type=\"RC\" href=\"/resource-catalog/supercomputers-for-academic-research-at-iu\">Research Supercomputers</CatalogPill>.\n- <CatalogPill type=\"RC\" href=\"/resource-catalog/uits-research-technologies-storage-service-geode\">Geode Project:</CatalogPill> Geode-Project is a fee-based Research Technologies service providing disk-based persistent storage allocations to research projects using Indiana University's <CatalogPill type=\"RC\" href=\"/resource-catalog/supercomputers-for-academic-research-at-iu\">Research Supercomputers</CatalogPill>. Geode-Project allocations are hosted on <CatalogPill type=\"RC\" href=\"/resource-catalog/uits-research-technologies-storage-service-geode\">Geode</CatalogPill>, which is co-located at the IU data centers in Bloomington and Indianapolis. Files stored in Geode-Project space are replicated, by default, at each data center. Project space users can access Geode-Project directly from all IU <CatalogPill type=\"RC\" href=\"/resource-catalog/supercomputers-for-academic-research-at-iu\">Research Supercomputers</CatalogPill> and remotely from personal workstations connected to the IU campus network.\n- <CatalogPill type=\"RC\" href=\"/resource-catalog/uits-research-technologies-storage-service-sda\">Scholarly Data Archive:</CatalogPill> The Indiana University Scholarly Data Archive (SDA) provides extensive capacity for storing and accessing research data. The SDA is a distributed storage service co-located at IU data centers in Bloomington and Indianapolis, providing IU researchers with large-scale archival or near-line data storage, arranged in large files, with two copies of data made by default (for disaster recovery).\n- <CatalogPill type=\"RC\" href=\"/resource-catalog/google-share-drives\">Google at IU Shared Drives</CatalogPill>: Google at IU Shared Drives are a paid storage option for faculty and staff. The sharing settings allow secure collaboration on files and folders. (Note that Google My Drive is not considered an appropriate location for storing research data.)\n- <CatalogPill type=\"RC\" href=\"/resource-catalog/protect-sensitive-data-microsoft-at-iu-secure-storage\">Microsoft Secure Storage</CatalogPill>: At Indiana University, institutional data must be stored in a non-individual storage space, such as Microsoft Teams at IU, rather than in individually owned storage space\n- <CatalogPill type=\"RC\" href=\"/resource-catalog/cloud-storage-portal\">Cloud Storage (Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure)</CatalogPill>: Cloud computing is the delivery of shared, on-demand computing services over the internet (\"the cloud\") to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale. Cloud services include servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, intelligence, and more. You typically pay only for what you use, helping lower your operating costs, run your infrastructure more efficiently, and scale as your business needs change. This lets people access and share information at any time from multiple devices, rapidly deploy computing services without purchasing hardware, temporarily leverage massive computing power, and more. Indiana University has contracts with Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure.

Security requirements which will vary depending on how your <CatalogPill type=\"RC\" href=\"/resource-catalog/udmc-data-sharing-handling\">data is classified</CatalogPill>. Within this section, you can explore options and requirements for data sharing. In addition, an increasing number of scientific publications are requiring that data be shared as a part of publication. \n\nDepending on data use agreements, licenses, or contracts, other researchers may be able to use data that you have purchased, thus allowing for shared use of resources, especially within the Indiana University system. This enables others to conduct research using the same data, without having to necessarily make additional purchases. The Research Data Commons helps facilitate sharing and accessing data within the university, to relieve the burden of data owners from having to take the time to provide access to others. \n\nAdditionally, sharing your data benefits researchers by generating new opportunities for collaboration by making it easier for colleagues to discover your expertise and work, increasing the impact of your research, and enhancing scientific integrity. Sharing your research benefits others by fostering public trust in science, encouraging a culture of openness and accountability, promoting scientific progress, and encouraging collaboration. It also helps to grow the economy, improve the integrity of the scientific and scholarly record, and accelerates the pace of discovery and scientific breakthroughs.

        "content": "Best practices for choosing a repository vary, but in general, researchers are encouraged to use (1) specific repositories, (2) subject-specific repositories, (3) institutional repositories, or (4) general repositories, in that order.\n\nBelow is a flowchart prepared by the IU Research Data Steward that advises how to find repositories to utilize in sharing your data.\n\n<img src=\"/img/faqs/which-repository.png\" style=\"display: block; max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 1rem;\" alt=\"Which data repository? Does the funder require or specify? Does the journal require or specify? Is there a disciplinary or data-type specific data repository? Is an institutional data repository available? Choose a generalist repository.\"/>\n\n## Specific or Required Repositories\n\nIf your research funder or sponsor requires a specific database to store and share your data, then use the repository specified by your funder or sponsor.\n\n## Subject Specific Repositories\n\nIf your funder or sponsor does not require a specific repository, there are many specialized databases that you can use to store your data based on your discipline of research. One way to find a specialized database is through the <CatalogPill type=\"RC\" href=\"/resource-catalog/re3data\">Registry of Data Repositories (re3data.org)</CatalogPill>, which aggregates data repositories by domain. You can also use the <CatalogPill type=\"RC\" href=\"/resource-catalog/data-repository-directory\">Data Repositories Directory</CatalogPill> to find lists of active repositories by subject. One major repository that Indiana University belongs to that serves a broad research community is the <CatalogPill type=\"RC\" href=\"/resource-catalog/ssrc-inter-university-consortium-political-social-research\">University of Michigan’s ICPSR (Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research) repository</CatalogPill> for social and behavioral research.\n\n## Institutional Repositories\n\nInstitutional repositories are general repositories that serve an institutional community. <CatalogPill type=\"RC\" href=\"/resource-catalog/iu-libraries-scholarworks\">IUScholarWorks</CatalogPill> is a repository hosted by Indiana University Libraries and serves IU Bloomington, IU East, IU Kokomo, IU Northwest, IU South Bend, and IU Southeast. <CatalogPill type=\"RC\" href=\"/resource-catalog/iui-dataworks\">IU Indianapolis DataWorks</CatalogPill> serves the IU Indianapolis community.\n\n## General Repositories\n\nThere are several general repositories available to store and share your data. Examples include <CatalogPill type=\"RC\" href=\"/resource-catalog/figshare\">Figshare</CatalogPill>, <CatalogPill type=\"RC\" href=\"/resource-catalog/zenodo\">Zenodo</CatalogPill>, and <CatalogPill type=\"RC\" href=\"/resource-catalog/dryad\">Dryad</CatalogPill>.\n\nYou can find additional information regarding repositories and how to make your data accessible through the <CatalogPill type=\"RC\" href=\"/resource-catalog/scholarly-communication-department-open-data\">IU Libraries Open Data Website</CatalogPill>.",

In 1977, data for the latter were also introduced, with coverage extending from 1975.\n\nThe archive has almost 200 variables and contains data for over 200 country units, with provision for entries from 1815 (excluding the two modern wartime periods, 1914-1918 and 1940-1945). The basic structure of the archive is that of a rectangular matrix of periodically augmented records, each encompassing data for one country-year. The data is contained in the file and may be categorized in a variety of ways. First, all of the variables currently included in the file are longitudinal, rather than cross-sectional, in character.",

The P2P study links data on genetics, biology, and the sociocultural and physical environment to expand our knowledge about the factors that shape diseases and disease risk and affect treatment outcomes. In addition to demographics, the data set includes variables on a broad range of health behaviors and attitudes (including addiction and mental health), service utilization and attitudes toward those services, employment history, environmental exposure through work and home, and a social network panel that assesses the impact of social support on individual health. Basic physical measurements and saliva samples for genotyping were also collected. In collaboration with The Regenstrief Institute, the study will link respondent data to electronic health records where possible. Anticipating longitudinal follow up and future studies, respondents were consented for future contact, creating a rich, longitudinal, multi-level data set for future research on health and health behaviors.",

          "answer": "Sure, I'll go first. Hi, I'm Heather Coates. I'm speaking today in my role as the data steward for research data, but I'm also a data librarian at IU, Indianapolis. So the data steward roles are embedded within the IU data governance program, which helps to ensure the appropriate management and security of all data, all institutional data at IU. And so what that, what gets defined as institutional data is sometimes a little bit unclear. We're going to talk more about that later. So oftentimes I get involved in research data management and sharing when people have questions about data classification, data storage, where."
        },
        {
          "question": "Do I need to get an approval to use this third party, this external 2IU tool?",
          "answer": "So there's lots of examples. We're going to dive into those. But today here I'm speaking as the data steward. I can go the next. So my name is Will Drake. I work at the Center for Applied Cybersecurity Research briefly about CACR. We've got a lot of external funding where we help secure research and critical infrastructure. But for today, I'm going to be speaking in my role as a lead for Secure My Research, which is a service we offer to the entire IU research community. And essentially, we provide cybersecurity and compliance consulting to researchers. Our goal is to reduce your cybersecurity and compliance burden so that you can focus on research."
        },
        {
          "question": "Tim?",
          "answer": "Yeah, hi, everyone. I'm Tim Daniel. and I am also part of Secure My Research. I work with Will there in the CACR, and I was hired on a few years ago, and most of my time has been interfacing with researchers through our Secure My Research offerings that he just described. And I'm Casey Mumah. I'm an assistant director, and I use Human Research Protection Program or the IRB office, if you want to go with that acronym instead. So I supervise staff who review all social behavior on educational research and also serve as an IRB member. So my office might be the one most familiar to everyone because we're the people who actually review everything that involves human subjects research. Thank you all so much. I do want to make sure that I don't forget to put up a little poll for our participants before we go further. So we'll launch that and hopefully it will work. We'd just like to know a little bit, you know, what campus you're associated with, what departments or units and your status at IU. That gives us a little bit of information to know who's in the audience a little bit better. We'll just give a few seconds for people to fill that out. That looks like we have a lot of folks from Indianapolis, a mix of faculty, staff, graduate students, and folks that have been at IU for a pretty good range of time. Okay, good to know. Go ahead and end that. We can share the results. So you can see, too. Okay. So now that we've heard a little bit about your roles, in case you mentioned the sort of IRB being the group that often reviews all of your research, especially if you're doing human subjects research. So I feel like a lot of researchers, especially if you're working with human subjects data, think that IRB approval means their data management is just fully compliant. but we also know now that that isn't really the case."
        },
        {
          "question": "And so could you talk a little bit, each of you, about why that isn't really the case and how researchers should think about the different roles of IRB and data stewards and secure my research?",
          "answer": "I mean, I'll start off from an IRB perspective when we're looking at research. Our primary concern is going to be that safeguards are there for some. subjects and that it's ethical. And then data security is one of the more difficult things for us to address. When we're looking at criteria for approval, they're actually very, very vague. And they just say that there have to be adequate provisions to protect the privacy of subjects and maintain confidentiality of data. And that's kind of the extent of what the regs really say for human subjects research. It's a little pickier if you're working with HIPAA protected data. but we're behind no means experts in data security and control. And that's why we have all sorts of other people who are experts on that, who we can rely on for guidance and instruction. So when we're looking at explanations for how data is stored, our review tends to be a little bit more cursory. We want to see that it's on an approved IU system. And other people are responsible for figuring out which systems are actually sufficiently secure. for research data. And so long they're using something that they've said is okay, then we're going to be okay with it. So to add the complementary approach to that, so at IU, one of the sort of, I guess, biggest programs we have for ensuring that our data are appropriately secured and managed is the, data governance program. And we'll point you to some links so that you can understand what that context is. But the long and short of it is that leadership has empowered the certain units and the University Data Management Council to essentially carry out processes to ensure that any institutional data are appropriately secured. And the reason that we don't have sort of one group do that is that not all research data are subject to the common rule or the regulations associated with the IRB because not all research data is collected about people. We have animal care and use research. And so that is a different regulatory regime. We have data that are collected in the community or out in the field about animals, sometimes endangered species. So within the context of institutional data, we have lots of regulatory regimes that we have to ensure compliance with, but also ensure any legal obligations we have related to our contracts with other parties, with other institutions, et cetera, and deal with ethical guidelines. So the scope of the data governance program has a lot, has some overlap. with the IUHRP, but there's a lot of stuff related to data security and data management that sits outside of human subjects research compliance. So the broader data governance program has some processes you might be, you might have experienced. One of them is the software and services selection process and the third-party assessment process or the three-PA, and those processes are meant to help us determine our obligations with respect to the data."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is it data that's coming to us under a contract from a vendor?",
          "answer": "And we have certain obligations under that contract. So there's lots of different things we have to consider to determine our obligations, and then based on those obligations that we've identified, then we figure out what security requirements have to be put in place. Now, I, too, am not a data security expert. That is why we have our University Information Security Office and the Secure My Research team to help us, as data stewards, make informed decisions about whether a particular workflow or a particular vendor is an appropriate fit for data set in a particular use case. Sometimes, like when we use Google Drive or Microsoft Teams, we look at things very broadly and we try to approve it for everything, for all institutional data all the way up to critical, or all different kinds of data, because we know that it's meant to be used as an enterprise-wide tool. More often in research, we get requests from researchers saying, I want to use this particular app for my study because it does X, Y, and Z, and we don't have any tools that do that. And so that's why researchers often encountered this process in a sort of surprise context because they may not have encountered it before. So I might be getting too far into the weeds there. I'm going to pause there and see if that answered the sort of balance between HRP and, data governance. That's excellent, Heather, thank you. I will chime in with Secure My Research and how we kind of fit into all of this. And so one of the strengths of our unit is that we can help researchers out basically at any point in the lifetime of the project. So we can be engaged with researchers before they go through the IRB process, at IRB approval. And for example, there we can help answer questions on the questionnaire that might be related to things such as data storage or if the researchers, if you don't quite understand what some of them are getting at, we can help provide some guidance around those. And when a lot of times, though, we do engage with researchers long after the IRB approval process and sometimes there is a little bit of confusion around well like we've already been approved for our study you know why are we coming to you and we're really here to to help kind of fill in the gaps of what you may not know or where you need to know where you need to go next and so we provide kind of one-on-one guidance that that is really tailored to each individual project and where you are at the moment. Heather did a great job kind of describing that breadth and diversity that we see in research and institutional research. And we're able to be kind of the switchboard and connect a lot of units that need to do the discussing, as well as understand your project and your security needs to help you interpret those other policies from IU around security and handling sensitive data that still remain. That's great. Thank you all so much. Tim, thank you for also kind of teeing up my next question, which is actually about those policies. So Heather and Casey also mentioned all of these different regulatory regimes and these obligations that we have to figure out how to meet."
        },
        {
          "question": "So when researchers are dealing with research data at IU, more specifically, what key policies or processes should they be aware of here?",
          "answer": "Yeah, I'll jump in and yes, here we go. So these are some of the key policies, but unfortunately by no means are these the only policies that you need to be aware of. And I do just want to preface this. The research environment is complex and constantly changing. And so I just, if you're a researcher or you work on a research team, know that we don't, the institution does not expect you to figure this out on your own. We have teams like Secure My Research and Data Stewards and the HRPP to help you figure these things out. So don't try to figure this out on your own if you get stuck. Okay. So our core policies related to institutional data of which research data is a part are DMO1 and DMO2. And DMO1 talks about controlling and managing institutional data."
        },
        {
          "question": "And DMO2 talks about, and generally, how do we share data with third parties?",
          "answer": "And for this terminology is a little bit unusual. Third party means anyone outside of you. So the big sort of important thing to know about this before you look at these policies because it isn't actually stated in the policies themselves, but it is stated on the data management website, is that all institutional data, including research data, is owned by the IU Board of Trustees, with some exceptions. So for graduate students or for students, for example, who do research and are not supported by a grant that is managed by a. or is not really done using IU resources, the student owns the right to that work. However, lots of our students sort of sit in weird places where they are working on grant-funded projects, and so the data is not theirs. And the reason that the data is not individually owned by PIs is that from a compliance perspective, it's the institution that is obligated through our federal to comply with the common role. It is the institution that is required to comply with federal regulations under the OMB for grant reporting. So the institution is the body of compliance. And then the institution, although we don't communicate this super clearly, we're working on it, delegates some authority and responsibility to PIs with respect to data management and sharing. because of federal guidance, particularly around the common role and PII, personally identifiable information, and PHA under HIPAA, we have to review or control how data are shared in some cases to protect participants and patients. So that's the sort of, I think, core stance or policy that folks are often confused about partly because it's not stated clearly and partly because I think that stance has changed in higher ed over the last 20 years. There are some other policies. So in particular, if you do human research, if you do data with human research participants, there is a research data management policy that applies specifically to that kind of data. It's linked on this slide. And then the research office also maintains a list of other research related policies that it's helpful to know about not all of them are going to apply to every project. And I think this starts to get extra layers of complication when it comes to human subjects research are you've got your institutional policies and requirements, which as Heather mentioned, one of the things that I think is a common misconception is that oftentimes researchers don't own their data."
        },
        {
          "question": "It's actually owned by whoever sponsoring the research or the university, if they're using university resources to collect it, which can be really hard to draw a line on, right?",
          "answer": "Like if you're, you know, doing interviews, maybe you're not really using interview or IU research resources, but certainly if you're doing MRIs, IU resources are being used in your research. So figuring out data ownership is tricky. And then classification of data at IU, Tim and Lowell, can definitely talk all about this, about like the four levels of classification of data. And generally speaking, human subjects research data is going to be either restricted or critical with a few exceptions where participants have specifically said they're okay with the information being made public. That would be kind of the one exception. Otherwise, we're looking at restricted and critical data and it has to be stored appropriately. And then when we're looking at data as well, we have to think about if it's PHA, if it's subject to HIPAA or not, in which case it has to be treated accordingly. And then we have a lot of research that also is going to be using data that's subject to FERPA. And there are additional requirements about accessing that data and how that is stored. So additional layers that we have to think about for human subjects research data that can really change how that data has to be treated and stored. All right. And I'll add to that just a couple more. So there's like a policy called IT12 and a policy under that called IT12.1. Hopefully these are policies that you as researchers don't need to directly worry about. These are kind of supposed to be on your IT person to deal with. But they're important to just know that they exist. So Heather kind of talked about the policies that talk about how research data is considered institutional data. And then DMO1 also goes to breaking that institutional data out into four categories. And then IT12 is a policy that says, depending on the type of data you're dealing with, the system has to have specific security controls in place and then has to be approved for use with that kind of data. Again, hopefully your IT folks have all this taken care, but it's important to note because, like, say you truly do need a brand new system or a one-off solution for you. your research, just understand that there is going to be an approval process for that system itself to be able to be used with that data. Luckily, here at IU, we've got a centralized research technologies division that has a lot of pre-secured and pre-approved solutions available for you and for your research. And there's enough of those solutions that it's kind of hard to keep track of all of them and know which one is right for your research. And that's something that secure my research can help with. We can kind of understand your needs. identify if there's a pre-secured solution ready to go. If not, we can kind of help you understand what's going to be the quickest way for you to identify and get onto a solution that's got the best chances for a quick approval. Thank you so much, everyone. There are so many different layers of these policies outside of IU, within IU, and it's really helpful to have you help us navigate all of this and understand the landscape. We have mentioned the Common Rule a couple of times since this webinar is focused on your data and the IRB, so probably human subjects research."
        },
        {
          "question": "Casey, would you mind just giving us a quick description of what we're talking about with the Common Rule just to make sure everyone knows?",
          "answer": "Sure. So the Common Rule specifically refers to human subjects regulations that we use to review and classify research. And it's called the Common Rule because 17 different federal agencies. agencies have signed onto it. So it's kind of common to a lot of the agencies. It is not entirely universal. The FDA uses a slightly different version of it. National Institute's Justice uses a slightly different version and Department of Defense uses a slightly different version. But generally speaking, the common role is what most human subjects research is going to be looked at under. And even if it's not subject to the common rule, one of those other agencies, it's similar enough to the common rule, until we get into the nitty-gritty of our view, for the most part, we can still kind of talk about the common rule and it's going to apply. Okay. Great. Thank you. All right. So we thought it might be helpful to talk through a specific example and get the perspectives of kind of all three perspectives on the different things that come into play for managing a certain kind of human subjects. data, I guess. And I actually also think this might be helpful because I think when I first encountered this example, I didn't really think of what I was trying to do is disclosing data to third parties. And so I think it might also be helpful that way. So let's say hypothetically, although this is not actually all that hypothetical, as everybody knows, I have a research project where I conducted and recorded some interviews with research participants. And now I want to use some kind of outside service, like maybe an AI transcription tool to help me generate transcripts from those recordings, to save me some time. So this touches on all of your area. So let's maybe start with IRB. So if a researcher like me submits an IRB protocol mentioning using one of these third-party transcription services, what kinds of things does IRB consider when reviewing my protocol. Right. So we'll want to say that if you list a specific transcription service, which oftentimes people don't, and we're generally okay with that, it's one of the ones that's on the approved value list."
        },
        {
          "question": "If you list a specific vendor that's not on the list, then we know they haven't been vetted by the people who actually have security expertise, and maybe they're fine, maybe they're not, but they're not fine and that they're not on the list, right?",
          "answer": "Like, we know that they're not approved. All of those approved ones, we know that there are sufficient data security safeguards in place for that transfer of data."
        },
        {
          "question": "If we're looking at it from an IRAB perspective, and we want to say, are there sufficient safeguards to ensure the confidentiality of data?",
          "answer": "Well, that all goes out the window if you start sharing it with a third party and we don't know that they're secure. It doesn't really matter where you stored it if you give it to someone else and they lose it. So that's where those other folks come into play. and evaluate which of those third parties actually have practices that are adequate for securing the safety of data. And maybe I've entered into agreement with the university about how that data transfer process works and what their obligations as a holder of data are. So if it isn't already like a vendor that's already approved, it's not already on the list or it hasn't been reviewed, I'm interested in what happens next."
        },
        {
          "question": "Heather, can you talk about how the data stewards and data governance come up at that stage?",
          "answer": "Sure. So there's two pathways that you might potentially go down. So the first one is if you mention a specific tool and an IRB protocol, and it's not on the list, we actually will get referral or I will get an email from one of the HRPP staff saying we have a protocol. it appears to mention a third party or mobile app and they essentially copy the PI and whoever submitted the protocol and say a further data security review may be necessary. So this is outside of the SSSP 3PA process. Then biweekly the health data steward and the HIPAA privacy analyst and myself meet with Tim and Will, secure my research, to discuss these referrals."
        },
        {
          "question": "And what we try to do is determine, is data actually being sent out to a third party?",
          "answer": "Sometimes that is not actually happening, but it can be surprisingly difficult to figure out."
        },
        {
          "question": "And if so, can we minimize the data that goes out in a way that we don't have to do a full security review?",
          "answer": "And if not, then we need to do a full security review. And that's when we enter into this other process. Okay. So the benefit of this side process or this referral process from the HRPP is that oftentimes we find out about these things earlier in the process. And so we are catching researchers and having this conversation when they still have time to figure out an alternative if it's appropriate or even just get the security review done before it delays the start of their research."
        },
        {
          "question": "because it's happening in parallel with IRB review and approval, okay?",
          "answer": "So we're catching things earlier in the process. That's the first pathway. The second pathway is if a researcher doesn't mention a particular tool or it's not related to human, it doesn't go through the HRPP, they submit an SSSP in order to get approval from purchasing to buy either a software package or to contract with a third party who might be, collecting data for them or storing data or passing data for multiple, there's an endless number of examples. But it starts with this SSSP form, which is frankly a little bit confusing and doesn't always use terminology that researchers are familiar with. So the information that we get from that is not always perfect. If someone requests something that has not been approved already, it enters into the third-party assessment process. Things that have already been approved, if you're requesting them, it should be auto-approved. You shouldn't need to encounter a data steward generally. There are some third-party applications that we approve on a case-by-case basis because of the types of data that they may deal with require additional controls or additional things on part of the research team. So some things are used use case by use case. All right. So when we get to this third party assessment process, the data stewards are really looking at what data is being sent out of IU."
        },
        {
          "question": "Again, does this sound familiar yet?",
          "answer": "And is there an indication that this vendor or third party seems to have appropriate security precautions in place for research data. So if we're dealing with critical research data that has information about human subjects or it contains PHI, that's a fairly high level of security controls that need be in place. And so we want to see some kind of documentation. We request something from them called a heckfat, which is something that was developed within EDUCOS. It's a very technical thing. We also will look to see if they have other security certifications because sometimes that's an indication to us. They know how to handle data. They know how to protect it. So that's when we either ask the UISO to do a review or sometimes we refer to secure my research to see if the data can be minimized so that we're not sending protected data out. So I'm not looking at the technical details, our security analysts and UISO are, or Tim and Will are helping researchers sort of make choices that minimize the amount and risk of data that's going out. Okay, so I'm going to stop there and let Well and Tim talk about the more technical piece. That's wanted to add one quick thing. Sorry, Well, one of the really tricky things for the issue of minimizing data that goes out is, you know, some data is subject to HIPAA and it's critical. A lot of research that is restricted, but by default, audio recordings are considered identifiable information by the Office for Human Research protections. So audio files are always going to be identifiable information. So minimizing what goes out is going to be very, very difficult when you've got a recording. Sure. Yeah. Yeah, so the kinds of things we do, we kind of look into the vendor. We kind of look and see what kind of security policies and information they provide. That minimization piece is really one of the things we focus on. And it may not be specific to this use case, but I can give an anecdote that kind of gives a really good example of the kind of things we do in the power of minimization, where it's possible. We had a researcher that was using a third-party application where they were collecting all kinds of information and sending it to a third party. One of those included, like, full dates of births. And so based on the cases, that meant PHI, like actual protected health information, was going to a third party. And when you run into that situation, not only doesn't need a third-party review, but because of HIPAA requirements, you have to have what's called a business association, agreement in place with the third party. And that third party wasn't willing to sign a BAA. So we reached out to the researcher. That researcher, because they're not hip experts, that they didn't understand that the full date of birth made it PHI, but they didn't even need that. They just needed the year of birth."
        },
        {
          "question": "So we actually then went back to the vendor and say, hey, can we change this field for this study team to only require a year of birth?",
          "answer": "And that worked out for the vendor. we were able to go back to the researcher. It all worked out. So then it was no longer PHA, and the researcher was able to get through much quicker. It just kind of shows an example of what we look for and how we can help with minimization and how powerful that can be when talking about sending data to a third party."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I just add one thing?",
          "answer": "So I failed. So when we get a security assessment, a risk assessment back from the security analysts, the data stewards use that to make a decision about whether a tool is appropriate for use with the data indicated in the request, but also maybe more generally that certain things need, certain controls need to be put in place by the research team or the requester in order to use that tool appropriately and protect the data adequately. So for example, if a third-party tool doesn't have two-factor authentication, that's not great. But there are. are ways to mitigate, or if other kinds of things that we normally like to see are not in place, sometimes that risk can be mitigated by the research team. So it's not always a black and white decision. So once that risk assessment or security report comes back, we make a decision. And then it goes to purchasing. And the additional controls that happen or the additional protection that happens of purchasing is that when we give or when we are trusting a third party with critical research data, we require a data security addendum that essentially holds them to the obligations to protect the data as we would. Okay. So that's an important legal or contractual control for us, which is why we do most of this process, not just to understand whether technically they can secure the data appropriate. but also so that they understand what obligations we are holding them to, and we have legal recourse if something happens. Now, I don't know how often we've ever pursued that, but it's sort of a normal business practice. And if a, like a startup doesn't know how to deal with that scenario, that tells us something about potentially their security practices. well that's a really great point um i did also just want to mention since i know we have a mix of faculty staff and graduate students i think graduate students often don't encounter that purchasing process directly um but a lot of those things being in place and sort of like using an approved service means that you know it's got all of that behind the scenes um which i think is great too um i wanted to pause for just a minute and just let the audience know if you have questions. Now it would be a great time to drop one of those in the Q&A pod. We'd be happy to answer them. I think we might have time to very quickly think about another example actually that would get at the minimization or some of the strategies that are similar to what we were just talking about that maybe don't work as well with audio recordings for transcription, but would work with other things. So we tend to think in the IRB world that, you know, when you're collecting data, it really means, you know, collecting data that is going to be specifically relevant to whatever question or theory you're trying to answer or develop. So one of the more common roles people will see, especially researchers, is HIPAA has the minimum necessary rule. If you're accessing HIPAA protected data, you're only supposed to access and or copy the minimum necessary to accomplish what you're trying to do. And as well mentioned earlier, there's the issue of, you know, a full birthday versus just a birth year, can still get the research or the necessary information, but clearly minimizes risk to participants reducing the actual possibility of harm if there's a breach of confidentiality. The same too, even with, you know, survey information and interview information if something is relevant to the research question, by all means collect it."
        },
        {
          "question": "And that can be really crucial when you're working with, you know, small populations where maybe you're going to have data that, frankly, isn't going to be large enough to be statistically significant, right?",
          "answer": "If you've got a population of 30 people, a lot of demographic information probably isn't going to actually be useful for a detailed analysis."
        },
        {
          "question": "Right?",
          "answer": "If you've only got, you know, three Asian Americans in your study, it might not be a super useful data point for actually drawing conclusions about what this data says about Asians. But it does make people more identifiable."
        },
        {
          "question": "So do you need it?",
          "answer": "Yeah, that's a great point. To add on to that, I will just, I will just say that in the data governance processes, we take a risk. management approach. And so when we see studies on rare disease populations or minoritized populations or very small groups where re-identification might be easily done, that is part of the consideration. And so it isn't an either or in terms of privacy or data security. It's an and both and the context really matters. So maybe just to go back to the transcription example, I think I generalize a little bit too soon there. So if you had audio recordings and you needed to get them transcribed, then you wanted to analyze them in the cloud. You might look for one tool that would do both, and you might run into some issues because the qualitative analysis packages that are cloud-based are not always the most secure, at least in our experience. So you might run your audio recordings through a transcription service that's already approved or ATS, which is the automated transcription service that's through the social science research commons or carbon copy and separate out the transcription piece from the qualitative coding piece. And that's another way to still have a workflow that's feasible, but a deal with vendors who are reputable and can handle the appropriate data security or prevent having to go through a data, a full security assessment process. So this is, I think, something that the SecureMy Research team is really good at is helping you sort of figure out and map out options and different workflows because they have lots of experience. and what works for one team may not necessarily be a workflow that works for your project. That's a really great point yet. It's not really possible to make audio recordings, not PII, but it is possible to mitigate risk of the sort of transcription output. We actually do have a question that does relate to kind of thinking through specific types of workflows for Secure My Research. So one of our attendees is asking can secure my research help with thinking through data flows with IU studies, that also include IU Health data. Yeah, that's absolutely something we can help out with. You know, basically, again, at any stage, so say you haven't even reached out to IU Health and gotten like data with a data use agreement, we can start helping you conceptualize the right places to put that data because it's very likely going to be protected health information. We've got a good set of systems that are pre-approved for that. If you need something custom, we can help you start identifying. identifying good ways to do that. Say you've already worked with IU Health and you've got data under a data use agreement, we can help you understand those security requirements in that data use agreement and map those requirements to specific systems that are ready to go. So yeah, in multiple different ways, we would be happy to and able to help with that. I think we have enough time left to briefly talk about the other example, at least some. I think we've already touched on some of the key points already, but we've talked a little bit about the idea of using apps for research as well. And it sounds like researchers are increasingly interested in using third-party mobile apps for research. So this could be things like using data from Fitbit, from My Fitness Pal or other apps. And so if a researcher wants to do that, I'm interested in what you think the first things are that they should consider."
        },
        {
          "question": "And so maybe starting with Secure My Research, what kinds of things would you do to evaluate the security and compliance of those kinds of apps?",
          "answer": "Sure."
        },
        {
          "question": "Yeah, we would kind of sit down with the researcher and understand, like, you know, what data is that third-party app going to collect?",
          "answer": "There's been multiple times where, like, Tim and I have reviewed a protocol, identified the app, actually installed it on our phone and seen what steps it, like what data it asks you for to become a user. there. And so that's where we'd also kind of bring in some minimization steps specific to that. Like, for example, you can, we've helped researchers create fake email addresses for their users to be able to sign up for these things without having to give their personal email address. And then, you know, seeing if the app takes like a fake date of birth and all that kind of stuff. And also understand that, you know, making sure we don't do that in a way that's going to cause issues for the researchers themselves. And then some other things we've done is, you know, if needed, we've helped researchers set up like IU accounts and then they've been able to use like those IU email addresses and stuff like that. We've even had some cases, it would only work for a small research study size, but where applications have needed a phone number, we've helped researchers get like a pool of phone numbers that they were able to use for study participants to put into these apps again. So, again, we would first understand what kind of information that app is collecting and then really try and minimize the amount of real PII that has to be handed over to that application. And then say, you know, based on what the end result was, we'd kind of report that back to Heather so that you can get, so we can get things moving on that, that governance. side approval, and then we'd also refer to IRB for that. I'll just jump in here and kind of add that by the time we secure my research are looking at it. We generally have a protocol or some other information where it's kind of described what's planned in this study project, and it really helps us out. We've been talking a lot about this minimization, and in our heads we're thinking about how can we help researchers in this area. And so we do really use what's written in the protocol as a guide before we have a chance to talk to anyone. So if that's clearly outlined, what is intended to be sent to third-party apps that does help us potentially not have to meet with you one-on-one, although we are always happy to do so and hear about your project and your own words. Because we find that exciting and there's a lot of diversity and research out there. and it's how we learn more about this stuff ourselves. Thank you. That's great. And those are some strategies that I actually didn't even realize you'd been able to do for researchers. So I'm excited that I'm learning new things too. You mentioned Tim the protocol."
        },
        {
          "question": "So Casey, for IRB, what do you think the researchers need to describe in their IRB protocols and maybe what kinds of issues arise if they're not specific?",
          "answer": "enough about maybe like what app features they're using. Yeah, so the first one is sometimes they don't tell us what app. So make sure that that's included because that's going to be a big one. There's also some studies the researchers have the funding to actually provide a smartphone or device to the participants rather than ask them to download the app to their own personal devices. That can be a very useful thing for security since then we don't have to worry so much about that app having access to their contact list or things like that. But of course, the app might still decide to turn on their microphone or camera or use location data. So Tim and Well and Heather still have a lot of stuff to look at there. We want to know what information the researcher really wants and needs to collect for the study. If you're using, you know, a Fitbit, most of the time what you're tracking is how many steps or what activity a person is engaged in. You probably don't need their location data. You probably shouldn't be collecting their location data."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is there a way to not do that?",
          "answer": "Because that's probably not crucial for the study. Maybe it is, though. Maybe there's a study where knowing location data actually is in some way relevant, and that can be explained."
        },
        {
          "question": "And if it is a device provided by the study team, is that device still connecting to the subject's home network?",
          "answer": "Because that is also a potential security issue. Now you've got this third-party app that has access to your router, and maybe that's a problem, and maybe it isn't. So we're going to be curious about all of those things. Mainly we want to know the app and what data you want to collect. And then we're going to make sure that Tim and Will and Heather have actually said the app is okay. We don't know the answers to those questions often. Yeah."
        },
        {
          "question": "Or at what point does data governance get involved?",
          "answer": "Yeah. So this is the role of that SSSP and 3PA process is to both document and enable the sort of shared responsibility across the different teams. So if you're requesting something that's already been approved, the SSSP form or the request gets auto approved generally. And then if it's something new, that's when we have to do, if we actually have to send protected data out to that third-party application, if it's required by the research protocol and we can't minimize the data, especially with a lot of health studies, that is the case. We have to submit PII. Then we have to check the security of the security controls that are implemented by that third party. Now, when we're talking about Fitbit or My Fitness Pal or Garmin or any of the other sort of smart devices that capture an incredible amount of data, the likelihood of them engaging with us by completing a heck fat is very, very, very low. Facebook is not going to complete a heck fat for us. It's just not worth it for them. And in fact, some of our vendors, some of the vendors who you might want to do business with will not do that because academia or higher ed is not their primary customer base. So, If a vendor won't work with us, we have a couple of options, one of which is we gather as much information as we can and base a decision on that. The other is we choose another option or we ask you, the requester, to choose another option. In the case of things like Fitbit or My Fitness pal, usually we can accomplish, we can enable people. people to use those tools through a combination of data minimization, good security practices or good controls on the research team part, and a data security addendum. Oftentimes, vendors will sign those. Very few will refuse, but we have had people refuse that. Just to note, a data security addendum is different than a business associate agreement. A BAA or a business so it's not always black and white it can be it can be complicated but the decision-making process is enabled by us getting good information from you about what data is going to go to that vendor potentially and communication with the vendor potentially if you can facilitate getting us the information we need from in that heck fat oftentimes you as the customer have a better chance of getting a response from them than I do. So there are multiple outcomes possible. What we like to see is the straightforward path of, okay, we have to send, you know, if we have to send them these protected data, they comply, they work with us, they give us this information, the security controls are good enough, we can approve. And then it's a tool that hopefully multiple people can use, and it's a solution that's available for lots of research projects. Sometimes we do approve things on a one-off basis. We try not to do that because it's a lot of work. Yeah. Well, we actually have one related question in the Q&A about using these kinds of apps and kind of what counts as PII and what doesn't."
        },
        {
          "question": "So the question is that, you know, if the subject and not the researcher is putting information to this app like Fitbit or whatever, is it still considered PII and does it matter if a subject would have not entered that info if it weren't for the research project?",
          "answer": "So I guess if I was already using my Fitbit app and I give a researcher access versus someone asks me to sign up for the research. So from an IRB perspective, then the data and the risk associated with it being in Fitbit if they already have an account and are using it exists independently of the research. They're not being asked to do anything differently as far as inputting data. But now somehow the researcher is getting access to it. So we'd be curious how that process is working."
        },
        {
          "question": "Are they giving them their username and password?",
          "answer": "A lot of questions about how they're getting that data. If it's, you know, they're using it specifically for the study, it's going to be PII almost certainly because even if they're using a fake name and email address and phone number with their Fitbit account, presumably the researcher has a coded list somewhere that lists, you know, subject one to subject one's name. So it's PII spread across multiple databases, but it still went together in some way, even if it's maybe less identifiable directly to Fitbit and its owners."
        },
        {
          "question": "Heather, Tim, well, do you have any other takes from your perspective?",
          "answer": "I'll just say that this exact scenario is something that we are trying to figure out our approach to. On one hand, if you are given a Fitbit as part of a study and you didn't have one before and you have to create an account to participate in the study, then that data is created because of your participation, that's pretty clear. When you already have an existing device and you are asked to, like, export the data from your account and provide it to the researcher, that's a little bit of a different scenario from my perspective. So I don't have a clear answer to that at this point. I think this is where you really start to see the scope and the perspectives that we all have are slightly different. So I'll let Tim or Will weigh in on their perspective for this one. Yeah, like Heather said, this is a very recent work in progress. And where it gets even more gray is like, for example, say, for your research study, the recruitment was done through like some kind of clinic or clinical nature. You put in the data and the outcome of this research project feeds back into your clinical, into the participants' clinical care. There's an argument there that then it could be considered PHI and then it gets very gray. So, yeah, like I said, we're working on it. It's a much more complicated question than I think I even realized when I asked it. We're almost at the end of our time, so I want to try to wrap up a little bit, even though I think that there's a lot more that we could have talked about with third-party apps and all of these options."
        },
        {
          "question": "So just to kind of wrap up, I was just wondering if each of you could tell me, kind of, what is one thing that you wish more researchers knew about research data compliance?",
          "answer": "I can jump in and go first. I'll just say just no groups like Secure My Research exists. Like Heather said, we don't expect everybody to be going at this on their own. And feel free to reach out to secure my research any time. We've heard directly from researchers that the earlier they reached out to us, the more we were able to accelerate their research. So reach out to secure my research early, and we can kind of take it from there. I know there's a lot of confusion talked about, especially like policies and that kind of stuff. We kind of take that load off of you so that you can focus on your research. And we really do try and take care of as much of the back-in stuff as we can. I'll go ahead and contribute mine after Will. And, you know, we've been talking a lot about minimization of data in this already. but I think that as a broad principle would kind of be my first suggestion. And it originally comes from HIPAA as the minimum necessary standard, but it can broadly be applied to almost any research or application as well as kind of in your day-to-day life and your own personal needs if you're trying to look to be a little bit more secure in your own habits. But basically it's kind of a three prong. We talked about minimizing. the data and data elements. But really, you want to think about it in terms of when you're thinking about designing your study, it can benefit a lot by starting from how can I minimize the data elements I don't need."
        },
        {
          "question": "How can I minimize the number of locations and copies of this data that I have?",
          "answer": "Don't store more than is necessary for your work. And then the minimum amount of access, people that don't have a need to access the data shouldn't. And by kind of keeping those three things foremost in your mind at the beginning, I think can help a lot down the line."
        },
        {
          "question": "ACD, want to go next to?",
          "answer": "Sorry. I would say for me, it's absolutely the same as well knowing about secure my research and that that program exists would probably save a lot of people a lot of time and effort because if we saw early on, there are a lot of IU policies about data storage and management. And unless you're an IT professional or a data security expert, you're probably not going to know the right way to comply with all of them or the right systems used to make sure your data is stored securely and that the people who need access can access it and the people who don't can't. So if you're going through Secure My Research, that part will be made much easier for you. And then the IRB won't have an issue with how you're storing your data because you'll have already gone through consultation with the experts on how to do that, and we'll be happy, and that will be one less thing you'll have to worry about having to get revised. I will third, the suggestion, go to SMR, go to secure my research as early as possible, not just because, for many reasons. One, our data governance processes are built to suit all kinds of data and institutional data and so researchers often struggle with some of the terminology or don't know what information needs to go in a particular field and will and Tim know these forms by now but also they know the they understand what questions are helpful to build out the context around the processes that you might have to engage in So talk to secure micro research as early as possible, but also there are lots of other folks who you might feel are sitting in a compliance role whose job really it is to help you and your research. So if you encounter someone, whether they are in proposal development or in the HRPP, remember they're here to support the research. to enterprise. And yes, they have processes to administer, and I will say this for myself. The processes aren't perfect. We know that. Talk to a person. Ask your questions. Try to get help. Even if you don't submit the form and you're unsure how, what information needs to go into it, it's okay to reach out to a person. Like that is not. That's, that's, that's, we have formal processes for a reason, but sometimes it's not the best place to start. So that was a really long and rambling way of saying, reach out to secure my research or the other context that you've built up in your school or department or on your campus. There are hundreds of people who are here to help you with your research. Thank you, Heather. And thanks Casey and Will and Tim as well. We are already past time. So we put up the contact information. I also just share, re-shared the slide link which has had a few other resources that we didn't discuss directly, but might also be helpful. So thank you for joining us today to all of our panelists and to the audience as well. I really appreciate it. Thanks for having us, Emily. And thanks everybody for joining. Thanks, everyone. Thanks, all. Thanks, everyone. Thank you. Have a good evening. You too. Finding IT Support for your Research Data Needs more 10, 20 seconds before we get started. Okay, we'll get started. Hello, everybody. I am Ann McCraney, I'm the co-director of the IU Research Data Commons, and I am delighted to be your host today for our discussion on finding IT support for your research data needs. We have a fantastic panel of research technology professionals from UITS here today that are going to tell us about how to find individualized support for your various research data needs. I'm going to introduce them in just a moment and we'll hear from each panelists about their specific area of focus and the types of research data supports that their units provide. We'll also be covering a wide range of topics. We're going to delve into common challenges and questions researchers face and how our panelists and others at IU can assist. We'll explore the various data storage options that are available at IU, including any underutilized or lesser known options. We're going to discuss IU's substantial high performance computing capabilities and how researchers can access these services. We'll learn about how programs and initiatives aimed at training students and faculty and leveraging IU resources effectively, what those programs are. And we'll also find out how to access one-on-one consultations and office hours for research data support. So I'm going to encourage you to ask questions throughout the webinar in the Q&A function here. We'll do our best to address as many of those as possible as we go. Also, we're going to be sharing a link to the slides. They're live on our website. So I'm going to ask one of my colleagues, Logan, to put a link in the chat to the slides deck that we're going to be going through so that you're welcome to download those and click along. There are going to be a lot of links. We're going to go to different websites throughout the course of the presentation. Also, the recording for this and the materials will be made available within a day or so. And we actually have some recordings from previous webinars that are already available on our website. And we'll share a link to that. as well. So before we get started, though, I'm going to ask you all, if you will, to take a quick poll to tell us about where you're from. So let me get that poll started for you. Oh, I believe has it started. Let's see. Oh, sorry. All right. Let's see. I'm having some issues here. So I'm stop sharing. I would like to relaunch the poll. Sorry about that. Okay. So I'm going to launch the poll here. It's just going to ask you four questions. We're interested in hearing you know, who you are, where you're from, and what your experience is at IU. This really helps us to know what these, how these webinars are, who they're reaching. So we'll give that just a moment. And then, well, let's see. Thank you all for responding. Looks like we've got almost many people responding so far. Okay, I'm going to let this run for just a moment. And I'm going to invite each panelist to introduce themselves and to talk a little bit about what their unit does. So we're going to leave this bowl running for just a moment longer, and I'm going to start with Essen, Essentuna. If you would please introduce yourself and tell us a little bit about your role and the types of research data support that your unit provides. I'm Essentuna. I'm the manager of the research data services team over here at Research Technologies. And my team is generally supporting researchers with data management problems, issues, challenges that they are facing. We have a number of services from my team in collaboration with my colleagues here and also across the campus as well. So we provide databases, data resources to researchers, and we'll talk about those, I guess, in just a few minutes. We will. And I'll move next to Abinov. If you, Abinov Thota, if you wouldn't mind introducing yourself as well. Hi, everyone. My name is Abinov Thoda. I'm manager of the research applications and deep learning team within research technologies. We do high-performance computing user support. We manage the software environments on research desktop, quads, and Big Web 200 systems. We do training workshops, one-on-one consultations. We also acquired and distribute vended research software for all of the IU community, among other things. Okay. I'll go to you next, Charles. Yes, I'm Charles McClary. I'm the manager of research storage within the research technologies division. I'm a part of the advanced cyber infrastructure group where we are groups sort of manage all the systems that are the HBC and storage systems, and I'll be representing our different storage systems we have available. Okay. And finally, Robert. I work as an engagement architect in the Research Partnerships Division, where we basically try to raise awareness of what services research technologies provides, both in the compute visualization and storage site. We're partnering with research teams to educate them and help them onto the systems. Okay. Thank you. So I am going to, before we get into discussions about the more advanced services that each of you and your units provide, I'm going to talk a little bit more about some of the more basic services that Uitts does provide. So the reasoning for this is that We have people coming from all over. So thank you to those of you who filled out our poll. It looks like we have about half Bloomington, half Indianapolis. It didn't look like I didn't see anybody with responses from other campuses, but we were pretty evenly split between staff faculty and graduate students and we had a variety of experience at IU. So we do wanna share a little bit about basic computing resources here, knowing that a lot of this actually will get you to these folks, but it also is really critical to you getting your research work share a few slides pretty quickly, and then we're going to move into our discussions more about the more advanced topics. So the first thing I want to make sure that everybody is aware of is that Ewitz offers pretty significant help desk support for researchers. And you, if you have these slides, you're welcome to click through. You can go directly into a page that essentially tells you about how many different ways that you can get help when you have problems at with using your resources. So this is just a screenshot of many of the resources there are there. And one of mine, I'm going to click out of this and actually take you to this page. One thing that I want to highlight here is under the need additional help. I personally use this yesterday. I probably used it last week as well, how you can actually contact people. So there are actual contact information for you for different campuses, so Bloomington, Indianapolis, and all the regional campuses. So you can always get information in chat. You can usually call and find someone, and you can also send emails as well. So I want to make sure that everybody is aware of that. Of course, another one of the major sets of resources that IU offers is, Of course, IUWare, the software collections that people have access to as members of the IU community. And so you can find a lot of material that's already there. You can also make requests from here to actually request for new software, new specialized software that you may not find. You can also get access to the research desktops, which actually have a lot of other kinds of software that are loaded with licenses that are available for you to be. able to use as well. Another, for those who've been around IU for a long time, the knowledge base has become Service Now, which is still a knowledge management system, and it has lots of information, lots of detailed technical information for you. And in fact, a lot of the resources that will be showing you today actually direct you to knowledge-based resource articles, which often will take you to a team or a person that you can ask for for assistance if you're having trouble actually getting your questions answered. In addition, there are a lot of different types of training, and I'll talk a little bit more about training, but I wanted to highlight one particular type of training that I, I think this is a relatively new organization of IT training at UITs. Maybe Robert can actually tell me about some of this because I remember it's been done differently in the past, but now you can find some both on-demand training, but you can also request specialized training or from a set of sort of predetermined topics that might be useful to you in a research group, and you can request specialized training for your group. So if you have a lab, if you have a group of colleagues, if you have, I believe even a group of graduate students or other students who requested training on these topics, you can actually contact you at's IT training and get in touch with them and they can actually bring people to you. But there are a fair a number of things that are on demand. You can see materials from previous trainings. Sometimes there are recordings, and there are also some Canvas courses that are available. There are some certificate courses as well. So in speaking about this, like I said, that's IT, U.S. IT training. There's also a collection of materials that's available in IU Expand and Canvas courses that you can go on to look at. There are certificate programs, too, for specific topics. And then I wanted to draw your attention to two sets of calendars. One is the UITS calendar. We just passed the majority of the UITs activities, I think, for this semester. So I was clicking on it today. And I didn't see much. They have speed dating for learning technologies. But if you come back, you'll actually see they were quite busy in the month of February with different activities, including with some getting started courses that you could take. In addition, though, the research software solution calendar contains links to even more specific and topics that we'll get into today. And these are on a different calendar. So I wanted to highlight these two different calendars. If you don't know where you're looking, you might miss these. But there are several different activities or events that are coming up this semester. So I didn't want to get into this too much, but I do want to again highlight another resource that I have found useful and that I've been able to share with other folks, which is the getting started tech guides that are available at the university that are actually geared to different groups. So you can find tech guides for faculty, for staff, for students, and also for collaborators. So if you work with someone who's from outside of IU and you have questions about what kinds of access resources they can have, you want to be able to send them something that gets them information about IU resources and understanding what they have access to, this is a good resource. So this can be really helpful for those of us or for those of you and research teams who work especially with outside collaborators and need to get those sorts of materials and information to them. So, and then finally, my last plug is actually for the IU Research Data Commons, which of course I mentioned, I'm the co-director of the IU Research Data Commons. It's a relatively new initiative of the vice president for research, and it brings together a number of different stakeholders, including the libraries, UITs, and IU research. And our mission is to support production, sharing and collaboration around research data infrastructure at IU. And we really think about that in the full life cycle of data. So some of what we do is what we're doing right now, which is education, but we also are collecting information and trying to create frequently asked questions. If you visit our website, you will have the first sort of graphic that you see links you to question sets that we have developed over the last year to help people get started with planning research, acquiring data, you know, actually working with policies and procedures, storage compute and analysis, sharing and archiving. So really what we think of is our, we have a big picture mission to help IU researchers understand what's at their fingertips. So research computing is a big part of that, but it's not all that's there. So we'd encourage you to take a look at this. One of the other things that we do is we do also try to collect every single event that we can find at IU across campuses that we can link and share for you that you can find that is a related to. research, research data, analysis, training, you know, policy, procedure. So you can see it's quite a large list of activities that you can go and find. So if you're aware of something, by the way, you're always welcome to share it. And if you want to go visit our website and you have questions, you'll see a link on every page that invites you to ask us more questions, which we will develop into more answers. And we'd also be happy to assist you. So that was my whirlwind view through the basics of Uitts infrastructure and offerings. There's so much to be had at IU. But now we're going to focus our attention on more specific help for researchers who need more specialized support and services in their computing needs."
        },
        {
          "question": "Yes, the number one question that we get is, I have this data set, where can I put it?",
          "answer": "And typically, it is a relational data that they have at hand coming from a database. And if you don't know what that is, a relational database is simply a set of correlated tables linked together. And we have a couple of technologies that is very common that we use at our new here. One is MySQL database and the other one is Postgres."
        },
        {
          "question": "And when a researcher asked, how can I bring that database up?",
          "answer": "Well, we do have such a service that we run centrally. It's called Research Database Complex. And well, very conveniently, it has the acronym RDCs. as well. It may be a little bit confusing, but the research database complex has been here at our year for over two decades now. And what we do is we set up a database instance for the client, and we give the keys to the database to our client, and they do whatever they want with that database. And a couple of interesting features of that is this database. is central abandoning, so they don't have to worry about patching it, worrying about security of it. And moreover, our research database complex is HIPI-aligned, so they can store PHI in that database structure as well. So that's typically number one question that we get, and we do have a solution for that here at research technologies. Another challenge that we get a lot, and this has been increasing over the last several years now, what to do with large data sets that a researcher needs to share within or externally, within I, you or externally, and sometimes publicly. And we have been looking at that problem for some time, and over the last couple of years, we have come up with a homegrown solution for that. And thanks to our research storage thing, we enjoy the benefits of having a very large tape archive here at IU. And leveraging that, what we do is we provide a front-end interface that allows searching of the data. And if the data is well organized, and we see to that with the help of the researcher, we organized it, we put it on the Scholarly Data Archive, which is our tape archive, and make it available for download. And again, this is central managed so that they don't have to do much of anything except organizing the data so that we can package it up and put in the STS scholarly data share system. And in fact, the Indiana Spatial Data Portal that serves over about 100 terabytes of states, your spatial data is built on top of the scholarly data share platform that we run. Well, we also have a couple of other interesting specialized data services that may be of interest. One is the radars restricted access data remote server. It is a lockdown server for vended, restricted data. And this service is also HIPI aligned as well, so we can store a PHI in that. Another service that we run in collaboration with SSRC like radars is the automated transcription service. And again, this service is allows a PHA in it as well. So those are the typically questions we get from the researchers and we do have a very good robust services to answer those challenges. Great. Thank you for sharing."
        },
        {
          "question": "And are they also available to graduate students or to other researchers who might have specialized needs?",
          "answer": "I'm gonna say all of there about our services are for everyone at IU, faculty, staff, students, grad students, And some of our services will require a faculty sponsor, but I'll let Robert take that question a little bit further. Okay. I appreciate that. All right. Well, thank you. I'm going to turn next to Charles. And let me get Charles up on the screen here. Hang on just a second. Okay."
        },
        {
          "question": "So Charles, can you talk a little bit about some of the data storage options that are available at IU?",
          "answer": "I know that's in your area."
        },
        {
          "question": "And can you tell of us any that you think that are underutilized or not known about as much?",
          "answer": "Well, we'll talk specifically about the storage options that are within the research technologies purview. I think that's where we're going to support there. We do have three storage services that are, each specifically tuned for for their need all HPC related the first one we can talk about is the storage service called slate slate has three variations of it which is that serve different needs and they can be looked up on that but those are that service is primarily designed for high performance compute jobs and workflows we also then have another storage service called geode and there's a couple services on that as well that is a disk storage system as well but it's more it serves two purposes one when you log on to one of our HPC systems you'll get a home directory you'll work from but every HP system that we have you're all in a unified home directory in other words you're in the same storage and you can be able to leverage scripts and code and maybe some configuration files that you have on one system that you might want to use on the other all right there for your fingertips. So Geo does host the home directories. It also provides a general purpose storage area that you can think of kind of like as a file server for your lab, your department, or your work group. And those that can be asked for and we can provide any sizes needed for that within some reason. And the big storage we have is the scholarly data archive. That particular service is a tape archive. It has a disk cache front end, but we can take virtually any size storage data need that you need on that storage system. It is not for compute purposes."
        },
        {
          "question": "It is there for storage for archive purposes or to store datasets that are too large for the purposes that you have now or for archiving, right?",
          "answer": "So if you've done with your research, done your experiments, you're done with those and need to wrap those up. The SDA is a perfect location for that. Essence tool that he has is the scholarly data share is backed by the SDA. And so if there's a need for sharing data from that, obviously not something that you want to be moving a lot of data back and forth with. But if you're going to share it with somebody, that is a great tool for using there. That is our storage services. And you can find at the link on the screen here, the research storage options, that is a web page or a knowledge-based article that will provide descriptions a little more detailed than what I just provide about those three storage options. There's also a fairly new tool out there that one of the research technologies teams has built called the Storage Finder Tool. And that is a tool that is many, several universities that are using and building and modeling from where you can put in some characteristics via radio box selections of what your storage needs may be or what your data might be, and it will give you what the storage options are best suited for for that. I think somebody else is going to talk about the Secure My Research somewhere else, and I'll leave that alone. But one tool that's probably underutilized, I think you asked that question earlier, one tool that we think is underutilized is in data movement. We subscribe to a tool and have it implemented here at IU called Globus. It is a fantastic data movement tool. It is not a single session type of thing. It is a fire and forget. In other words, you can say, hey, I want data to go from point A to point B. It will move it and multi-threaded if it can, so it'll be as faster than anything you can do by yourself. But you could also submit that job, close your laptop, log off your workstation, and the job will still stay back there and move as fast as it can when it can. And so that's something that's been a nice tool. It can also be set up to run from a laptop workstation or a lab station if it has the network capabilities to move data off of a workstation that's controlling an instrument and move it to storage. We also have it set up that if you're working with cloud storage that the university has subscribed to such as Google Drive or Microsoft One Drive SharePoint, that Globus tool can talk to those guys and move. data to and from those locations as well. I think another big underutilization, underutilized feature is that we do have these three storage services that they are specifically tuned for their specific purposes and people don't leverage those. So they'll get into situations where they've been given a quota of spinning disk storage. They'll fill that up and not think to, you know what, I can move some of this data that I no longer need immediate access to and move it off to lesser storage and take advantage of a much larger quota opportunities with a scholarly data archive, for example. Yeah, that's a great point. Thank you."
        },
        {
          "question": "Again, is this available to everybody at IU?",
          "answer": "Oh, yeah, you asked that. I forgot. Yeah, it's available to faculty, staff, and graduate students. And like Esson said, if there's other needs, a faculty sponsor can step in and help out, which we see often with researchers. Sure, thank you. It sounds in particular that Globus would be helped. of course if you have large data, if you have large quantities of things."
        },
        {
          "question": "Are there other reasons?",
          "answer": "Large and large data sets. If you have like many files and you want to get them to some storage centrally, like we've seen cases where researchers out in the field collected data on a laptop needs to move that data starting right away and you've got a connection that may not be super stable. Globus is smart enough to move much data as it can until a more robust connection is established, or as a network connection becomes established, and it will keep moving that data. Great. Thank you. So thanks. I'm going to move next to Abinoff, and I'm going to ask you, we know that IU has substantial high-performance computing capabilities."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can you tell us some specifics and how people can get access to these services and also just learn about them in general?",
          "answer": "Yeah. IU offers a comprehensive set of systems and services in the high performance computing space for faculty, staff, and students, both graduate and undergraduate. Faculty and staff can have access to everything that is, that we provide, and they can bring in their graduate students and students with them and they might have to give them, add them to their projects or give them the right permissions, etc., but it is available to everybody. And this includes computing, training, and user support. If I may, I can go over the two supercomputers that we have and talk a little bit about how they are positioned and what they are appropriate for. We have the Quads Cluster, which is a high-throughput system designed for general computing needs. And then we have Big Red 200, which is a great, system which is designed for large parallel computing needs. Both of these systems have GPU partitions for people with computing and AI workloads. While quartz and big grid 200 are available or accessible via the terminal, we also have something called research desktop or red, which is designed to be a graphical desktop gateway for all of the compute and storage systems we have, and this is super popular with our users, and for anybody who is not comfortable with the terminal and the command line, they can use Red as a gateway to storage and computer resources behind it. And in here, on the slide that we have here, I think the getting started with HPC article is a great place to start. It kind of walks you through all the things you need to do to create your accounts, you know, on compute, storage."
        },
        {
          "question": "How do you go from there to moving data, running jobs, so on?",
          "answer": "That's great. Well, thank you. And I'm going to jump to, you already told me that this is available to students and faculty alike. And so I'm going to jump to Robert. So let me. Okay, hi. Hi, Robert."
        },
        {
          "question": "So can you tell us about your units?",
          "answer": "In particular, I'm interested in your unit's curriculum in training faculty and students in the best way to leverage IU resources. Yeah. So research partnerships is really trying to amplify the services that are provided by units, like the research analytics and deep learning team that Abinab is running or the storage teams or or essence data team. So one thing that we do is really try to reach out specifically to research team leaders or group leaders to help them understand what the central offerings are. Two programs that we have developed recently in that area is the ACI, which stands for, or that's advanced computational infrastructure. Cyber infrastructure. Cyber infrastructure, advanced cyber infrastructure. The student fellows program and the curriculum fellows program. So the to answer your question, and so the student fellows program is available to undergraduate and graduate students, and the curriculum fellows program is available to faculty members that are teaching classes at IU. So in general, the directorate serves everyone at IU that is using the centrally provided resources. The student fellows program ran in the fall semester last year and also in the spring semester last year. And one thing that we've learned is that running the program for just one semester is a little short. And the program is really targeted at students and helping them use some of the centrally provided resources like quartz, Big Red 200, the storage systems to help them advance their research. So we're going to run a new version of this program starting the fall semester this year. So the solicitation for this should be out in June, July, and then applications probably open in August. And the program will start in September. It's geared towards students that have a, that already doing some kind of research with their advisor and need help on the central systems. to accelerate that research the curriculum fellows program is very similar it also runs for a year but it actually starts in the spring semester and runs to the end of the fall semester targeted at faculty members at i.u that are teaching classes and that would like to incorporate cyber infrastructure like our compute storage visualization systems into their curriculum So both programs consist of basically meeting with the participants talking in general a little bit about what is available, giving them some background information, but then also one-on-one consulting, where members of my director and members of other teams like Essen and Avinov's teams sit one-on-one with the students or the faculty members to help them integrate those resources into their classes. Yeah, I think this, I had not heard about this before just recently, but I think this is a great resource available to IU's community and you could really get creative."
        },
        {
          "question": "Do you have any good examples of either labs or groups that have brought you in or that have worked in this and then seen this implemented in their own work?",
          "answer": "So I'm hence on involved in the student fellow program while a colleague of mine runs the curriculum. program. And I'll just speak like 10 seconds in the curriculum one before I spend a little longer on the student one. On the curriculum side, we've, for example, worked with a professor from neuroscience who had already had his students use the research desktop and in quartz for some of the fMRI data analysis that they were doing. And we helped them really add to the slides that he already had in how to onboard people under the system, how to make sure that every student had access to all the examples, and then help them run those workflows a little bit more efficient than they had before. So it really made it much easier for the faculty member to teach using the central resources. A lot of people will develop their own slides based on how they use the system, but for us to come in and just augment them a little bit with best practices, made a ton of difference there. And on the student side, it's really trying to partner with students who can then also serve a little bit as a point of contact in the lab that they are working. So when we are working with a student and we talk about how to use, for example, Globus as a data movement tool that Charlie had talked about earlier, then having those students go back and in the next lab meeting talk about this and have other people in the lab use this tool, that's sort of the hope that we have with this program. Not every student is that well integrated into the research lab, but from the, I think, overall nine students that we've served over the two programs we had so far, at least seven or eight of them really have gone on and talked to other members in their labs and really have been an ambassador for those services, which works really nice for us, again, to emphasize and highlight those services. Yeah, well, thank you."
        },
        {
          "question": "I'm going to shut off our slides here for a moment, and I'm going to invite everybody back in because I'm going to ask a similar question to everyone else, which is, can you give us an example of how researchers have worked with you specifically?",
          "answer": "I might start with Essen. One perhaps an interesting interaction that started many years ago is with the, Now Gill Institute, actually Charlie at a storage consultation with Professor Lou, he brought me on along with him on that consult. And we started working with them, looking at their data, the complexities, what need to be done, how to organize their data, where to store it effectively, to Charlie's point earlier. we have a very interesting storage systems with varied properties. If you use them correctly, they serve you well. If you don't, they do not serve you well. So it was key working with them for quite some time figuring out the complexities, the access frequencies, what data they need to, what metadata they need to collect. and how from the lab members to organize the data. So that was something that sticks in my mind that was a very helpful consultation. That actually led into a grand proposal that establishing a brand new center at the GIL Institute, the C3A, the Center for Cannabis, and Addiction, And there, actually, in the inception phase of that grant, we helped them with having the knowledge of their data, how it worked, understanding the complexities, developed in data management and sharing plan that is required by NIH for any grant proposal in the last several years now. So that was an interesting, very helpful consultation both ways. We understood the, they start understanding the domain. Oftentimes we do not have obviously all that knowledge of a particular domain. So it takes some time for us to figure out how we can be helpful, how we can resolve those data management challenges. So that's sort of something that pops in my mind when it comes to data management to help and support at campus. Yeah, thank you."
        },
        {
          "question": "Are you partners in some ways?",
          "answer": "So I guess I can jump in. We have a facility statement that is, you know, that we update from time to time and that is available to faculty that are working on grants. And if we have had instances where faculty might write us and say, hey, I'm proposing to do so-and-so work that involves running jobs on HBC."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can you provide a statement saying that this is something that IU supports?",
          "answer": "Or, hey, I'm going to be doing proposing work in a proposal that includes, that says that I'm going to store so-and-so data, X number of terabytes."
        },
        {
          "question": "Do we have facilities for that?",
          "answer": "So those kinds of questions we answer one-on-one. We also provide a facility statement that kind of describes all the social. services in detail, but also specific. And I think faculty don't grab the whole thing, but they grab sections from it and use it as appropriate. Yeah. So I'm curious if any of your units or any of the areas that you're in offer one-on-one consultations with hooks. There's a lot of specifics."
        },
        {
          "question": "So Charles, you put your hand up?",
          "answer": "Yeah, that is something that we like to preach. And I think every group will like to do that is, you know, we can go out and provide training. and have the 20 to 60 people show up. But where the runner really meets the road and we can just feel the effect, the screen just went blank. Oh, okay. Is where we do a one-on-one. I think we would offer that up. We'll make time to do it. Two hours invested, for example, with somebody in their lab to understand what they're doing, it seems to be very profitable for both sides. one, the researcher gets a good view of an outside view of what they're wanting to do in organization of data, proper usage of different storage systems."
        },
        {
          "question": "In the case, we have two HPC systems right now, which is a better fit for them?",
          "answer": "Well, three, if you consider red. So that's a good thing, and it also is good for us because we get to hear new things that people are doing, and so we can tailor our services down the road for what these needs are. So, yeah, I think every one of us would be more than willing, and I say, us, I mean, our groups would be happy to do some one-on-one consults. Thank you."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is that the best way for somebody to start with you here and to get going?",
          "answer": "Yeah, I personally don't know what's behind that link, but if it's the generic research technology's contact form, that would be a good one to get started. because that'll get distributed to the right teams. That's it. I said teams intentionally because sometimes a couple of our groups have to get in and work. Oh, I like what Essend and I did. We ended up getting a ticket that we were working and it made a lot of sense for the two of us to partner up to provide the support. Well, thank you, Charles. I'm going to just throw this up and anyone who feels comfortable answering."
        },
        {
          "question": "Are there any books, websites, or resources?",
          "answer": "I can jump on that one real quick. You know, one thing that we see a lot of is people jump into the research real quick without a data management plan, without a data organization plan, without metadata, if they're using metadata to describe their data and help them down the road. And we usually hear about this later on. I can't find my data. I had a graduate assistant helping me and he stored his data in his account or her account is now gone and I can't reach them and I need access to their data. Boy, have a plan, management plan for your data before you get started. That's one piece of advice I could launch out there. Well, thanks for that. And that'll be a plug too for us. We try to help people develop those data management plans as well. So we'll be talking more about that. And I think that Logan advanced us to what was going to be my next question, which was workshops and trainings, which I went over just very broadly, the fact that there are some. But we definitely have some that are coming out of the research solutions group that are coming up here that are highlighted. I don't know if, Robert, if you would like to tell us a little bit about these or if there's somebody else who wants to take these on and describe why somebody might want to join these. Well, I'll let Abinov talk about those. Okay, thank you. Yeah. So we, across research technologies, we have half a dozen to 10, depending on the semester and the year training workshops that we offer every semester. These are all on Zoom. Many of them are recorded. So the, and I think I'm going to, you know, refer to what we were talking about, doing one-on-one. one consultations and conversations, you know, many of these workshops are pretty interactive. And because these are workshops intended to walk people through the steps to going from, oh, I'm brand new to all of this to, okay, I know what to do on how to get on with my research on the services you offer. So these are pretty interactive and it is not. uncommon to have these offered multiple times for different groups. I mean, there is the official one and sometimes a group or two comes in and says, actually, we have a dozen people that could not go to that."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can we do one directly for us?",
          "answer": "And then the calendar, the Research Hotfare Solutions event calendar has all the things listed. I think it shows upcoming. but there's a few that have happened already this year. I think the, yeah, I believe the getting started on HPC and storage is already done this year, but yeah. Okay, well, thank you. Thank you all for joining us today. I'm going to invite anybody who's in the audience to feel free to drop a question in the Q&A if you would like. If not, we will hang around for just a few more minutes and you can ask questions if you'd like, but I'm going to turn off the record. now. So thank you all. And then I do want to mention that we have a couple of more events. We have one tomorrow on working with your data and the IRB. And then we have some more. We're actually are featuring a conversation with Secure My Research, which is a group we didn't talk about very much today, but actually can be another hands-on help for you in working with secur Meet the IU Research Data Librarians I'm Ann McCranie. I'm the co-director of the I.U. Research Data Commons. The mission of the I.U. Research Data Commons is to support production, sharing, and collaboration around research data infrastructure across Indiana University. So this is all campuses and all levels. We're having a spring series this year. This is the very first one. It's a set of discussions around topics around research data resources and issues. And we're trying to highlight the many people who work on these topics around different units at the university and all around the different types of services that are available. So you can find more about future ones at our website. So today we're pleased to have some of our research data librarians here at Indiana University to come and talk to you about the work that they do, how they can work with you and what resources you have at your disposal when you do research at IU. And before we get started, I'm going to ask that you answer a very quick poll. So let me get that started for you. We are, I believe it only has four questions. We're just going to ask you to share where you're located and whether or not you're a staff, faculty member, student, and how long you've been at IU. So thank you for those of you who are answering. We'll give that just a second. I'll leave it open for just a moment, but I will tell you that just looking at the results, it looks like we have a split, we have some folks from East, we have some folks from Bloomington and Indianapolis. We have faculty and staff and graduate students. We have a number of folks who've been here for longer than five years, but many who have been here for less time. So thank you all for giving us that feedback. It's helpful for us to know who's joining us. Okay. So the first thing that I'd like to do is to welcome our research data librarians that are here with us. So we have three today. We have a fourth research data librarian at the university, Ethan Friedmanski was enabled to join us today, but he did send along some information, and so we will share that with you in just a few minutes. But before we get to that, I'd like to ask our research data librarians who are here today to actually give us a brief overview of their role at the university, and then what types of research data they support, research data support they provide. So, Corey, I'm going to start with you, if you don't mind, at our newest edition. Yeah, sure. So hi, everyone. My name is Corey Barber. I am the new Data Services Librarian at IU, Indianapolis. I am just now, I think, a month into working here. So still figuring out exactly what I'll be working on, but I know I'll be helping to serve the students here at IUND. Thank you."
        },
        {
          "question": "Heather, would you mind going next?",
          "answer": "Yes. I first let me just say I'm super excited to have Corey with us. So I'm Heather Coates. I am, I have a lengthy title. I'm the Digital Scholarship and Data Management Librarian at IU, Indianapolis University Library. Corey and I are in the same team. And I have been here since 2011 when I was hired to help prepare researchers and the campus for the NSF data management plan requirement. And over the years that the support that I provide has shifted. over time, but is typically included things like presentations and consultations related to data management and sharing plans, teaching students, which has been something in the past few years I haven't had time to do. So I am excited to have Corey on board and help us rebuild our support for student research, data management, and sharing. We also create guidance and curate trusted resources around specific issues on data management and sharing. And I'm going to reuse that phrase over and over again because it encompasses so many things. More recently, as federal funding agency requirements have shifted and in particular related to the NIH policy, there's been a lot of collaboration across the departments between the library and other departments, other research support units to really figure out ways we can help people get the information they need more efficiently so that if somebody comes to me with a question and I can only answer two thirds of it, I can get them to that last one third better, more effectively, more efficiently. So that's that's sort of what I've been doing over the last 14 years in a nutshell. And as Corey mentioned, she's really going to be expanding support for students. So if you're a student, please keep an eye out for her name."
        },
        {
          "question": "Heather, before we move on to Levi, can you talk a little bit about your role as the data steward?",
          "answer": "Sure. So I tend to compartmentalize these things for a couple of reasons. So the data steward appointment is separate from my role as a librarian and comes out of our university data governance program, which is administered under the vice president for information technology. So in case you didn't know, we do have a data governance program that helps us ensure the quality and security of data at IU. And that includes everything from human resource data to student data to information about facilities and research data. And so in the role of data steward, I do a number of things, including sort of help ensure that policies and processes support research data management. and sharing, and that's a very big umbrella, but that's not what we're here to talk about today. But if you see me talking about data governance or you see the term data steward, that's what that refers to. So it's a very specific role. We have different data stewards for different types of data or different domains of data. Thanks. I appreciate it. So Levi. Yeah, hi, everybody. My name is Levi Dolan, and I'm the Data Services Librarian at the Ruth Lilly Medical Library. So we are under the School of Medicine. So my primary role is to serve department, students, staff, and faculty in the School of Medicine. And a lot of the stuff I do are as a data librarian are similar to some things that Heather said. I do a lot of consults and workshops and one shot data-related instruction. And so I really like to think about the biomedical data life cycle and look through kind of each stage of it and work at finding where those resources exist to support researchers all through that inside of the school of medicine, inside of IU, external to IU, just figuring out how I can interface people to getting what they need to get to that next stage and whatever they're doing the best way possible. And some of the things that we do here, we spend a lot of time doing consults around and reviews around NIH data management and sharing plans. And then also at the library here where the site administrators for the electronic lab notebook solution for the School of Medicine, which is called Lab Archives. So I spend some time teaching classes on that and managing a shared notebook for people in that space. And then also we do some things like workshops around foundational computational computational skills like Python and some other things like that. We also work in some initiatives related to promoting orchid adoption across the institution. And that's really important related to the School of Medicine, partly because our major funder, the NIH, is requiring orchids for everybody starting in May 2025, just a couple of months from now. So there's kind of across the board, what we do is look at kind of what the hot spots are for the people that are doing research in the School of Medicine, and then also look for where the gaps exist and how we can help everything move along better in relation to research data. Thank you, Levi."

        {
          "question": "I know you said these are the services that I have, but I'm curious, like, what in a given week might be something that shows up in your inbox or at your desk?",
          "answer": "Oh, sure. I mean, of course, as you can tell probably from how we've introduced ourselves, that there can be a lot of variability in what happens. for sure there's going to be a little bit of more interest in NIH-related questions when there's like a grant funding deadline coming up. And then it also depends on just as we get kind of new postdocs and fellows and labs are getting set up. Sometimes we'll get kind of more questions based around setting up."
        },
        {
          "question": "how do we approach data management in general?",
          "answer": "And then just as we get new classes of med students every year, we have some kind of requests for things like data reproducibility-related training. And that's partly because the NIH requires you to show that you've had some kind of data rigoury and reproducibility training if you're applying for a research grant or a K grant, a trainee grant. So I think probably, if I would summarize it, I'd say most often we might get questions related to how do I work with complying with what my funder's asking for or get questions related to you. Actually, the way I'm collecting data is not really going to work with the setup that I have right now."
        },
        {
          "question": "And how do I put it in a place that the people I'm working with can also work with it?",
          "answer": "And so I think a lot of it will have to do with kind of those buckets, kind of external and internal. Thank you. So, Corey, I'm going to throw this to you. And I know that you're still new at your job. But what, I don't know if you've had folks come to you, but even if not, what are you hoping to have in terms of folks coming to you, with questions and requests. Yeah, so far I have not had any request. But I am hoping that I'll be able to help, you know, some higher level undergraduate students or some graduate students that are really getting into the beginnings of their research and kind of giving them the baseline skills that they need to move forward in their careers as researchers. Great, thank you. So you might come, I'm thinking in particular, faculty might refer students to you. That might be a good pipeline for folks to find you. Heather, I'm going to toss to you. Sure. So it's shifted over the years. And I, when I, so this is my first library job. This is our first, this is the, my role is the first campus data library. And I think I sort of expected people to ask lots of questions about data management."
        },
        {
          "question": "So how do I organize and document my data?",
          "answer": "And that has not been the case. Most of the questions that I end up fielding are related to data storage."
        },
        {
          "question": "So where can I put my data?",
          "answer": "It's got protected information or it's got critical information about either PHI or human participants."

        {
          "question": "Where should I put it?",
          "answer": "And partly that's related to the richness of I use cyber infrastructure. We have a lot of support. We have a lot of resources. It can be really challenging to navigate those. And people don't always know where to start or how to find stuff."
        },
        {
          "question": "So in the sort of data management bucket, I get lots of questions about storage, some about data classification, like how do I figure out what my data are classified as?",
          "answer": "That's a data governance thing."
        },
        {
          "question": "But also, when people are sort of not served by our core, or their needs are not met by our core services, people might come to me and ask, you know, where do I, where can I find a tool that will let me do X?",
          "answer": "So we have Qualtrics now, which is great. So that addresses a lot of the survey needs. But pre-enterprice level Qualtrix, we had lots of people sort of trying to pick between 20 or 30 different, software tools. So as, as technologies change, as compliance requirements change, the questions that I get change a lot, in the sharing bucket, a lot of the questions I've been getting over the last five years are related to. My publisher says, I need to make my data available to submit a manuscript. And those are usually, I have five days to figure this out rather than like at the beginning of a project or when we're writing up the manuscript. So those are fun and can be a little bit challenging to help people understand what their sharing options are in a tight deadline. And then in a related compliance sort of bucket are funder requirements, which people know about from the get go, but we don't really know how it plays out until the data are collected and it's time for them to be shared. The landscape is constantly changing. We are constantly see new data repositories created. So if you have, if you encounter any of these questions, ask a data library. And these are the scope of the things that we're constantly trying to keep up with and help people navigate. Oh, well, thank you. You know, my next question was going to be if you could give us examples of specific kind of projects. And you've given a lot of examples of sort of the generalities. But I'm wondering if there's any specific example of like someone came to me and ask me for help getting X done and I was able to do it. I think that can help people understand how they might slot in their own questions and work with you."
        },
        {
          "question": "Do you want me to go first?",
          "answer": "Yeah, sure, if you don't mind. Sure. So a couple of specific things come to mind. So one recently was a researcher who is funded by a private foundation. And when she submitted her grant four or five years ago, there was no data. sharing expectation. She completed the grant. She has the data, but now the funder says, we need you to share the data, and it needs to be shared openly. So I met with her and the program officer from the foundation, and we talked through what her options were. So initially, I had offered up our open data repository at IUND, which is DataWorks, but that was not on the foundation's approved list of data repositories. So we met, we discussed, I was able to translate what the foundation was looking for to the researcher and essentially say, yes, we can do this. So that actually involved a referral to, because the data had to be shared openly and they contained identifiable information about human research participants, the data had to be de-identified. So I referred her to our biostatistics service up here. they were able to de-identify the data for not much money. Since the grant was over, there was no funding left. And then we were able to, or I helped her document and submit the data into an approved repository for that foundation. So that's kind of an unusual example and that the expectation was sort of placed after the award was granted. Another sort of, I guess, specific example is when researchers are publishing in journals like PLOS, the Public Library of Science, certain publishers and certain journals have expectations above, so in some journals you can write a data availability statement and you say either I can't share my data because they contain protected information or I am sharing my data, here it is, or somewhere in between."
        },
        {
          "question": "Most of the time journals are pushing people away from, you can request the data by emailing this person at an email address, right?",
          "answer": "So when people have data that contains protected information, human research participant information, genomic data, or they could potentially be re-identified because it was data collected at a very specific site. It has a few people in it. It's kind of this balancing game, and I'm actually doing this today, between helping the researcher understand what their options are for sharing the data in a reading a metadata record, giving a statement that satisfies the publisher, but also giving enough information about the data and setting up that process for request within a very short time period. And so because many researchers have not done this sort of controlled access process, there's a lot of explaining and back and forth that has to happen. I think in a couple of years, more people have had exposure to it, and they'll understand, oh, this means that I need to have a read-me and I need to have a contact person who is not on my research team, and it will be a little bit more normal. But for right now, there's still a lot of education happening as we are figuring these things out in a very short time frame. Sorry if that was. No, that's a great. That's a great example. Thank you, Heather. I want to add, too, that part of the impetus for bringing an IE research data commons together is because there are so many different technical questions that people have, and sometimes they don't even know that there are issues that they need to address. So that is something that we're trying to help bring all these resources, and we count these folks that are on the call today among some of the most important resources that we have at the university for you getting your work done, you getting your research data, put in the right places, following all the right rules. And so we appreciate you all being here, but this is something that we're trying to do is also bring this information together to get you to the right folks. So thank you, Heather, for sharing all of that."
        },
        {
          "question": "Levi, is there any example that you can share with how somebody brought a question or an issue to you and you were able to help them work with that?",
          "answer": "Yeah, I guess one that we've worked on the last couple of years is little by little building up how we support the electronic lab notebook system. So that was something that was introduced at IU School of Medicine in 2018. And what electronic lab notebooks do is basically replace paper notebooks or they can replace paper notebooks. So then you can kind of all the things that your lab is doing and they'll be time stamped and it will tell you who did what and it's version controlled so you can roll back if you have any kind of change that you made that you need to go back to and that is a system that we've had many labs adopt but many also have not yet adopted so it's not something they're required to do at this point."
        },
        {
          "question": "So we really kind of started looking into, you know, know, what is it that people who are using it a lot are getting out of it, and what can we do to encourage other people to take a look at using that methodology?",
          "answer": "Because for a variety of reasons, it not only allows you to manage your data more precisely and be able to really have a record of how and when you did things, but also it saves you lab space physically, and it can also allow people to be able to work collaboratively a lot better."
        },
        {
          "question": "And so one of the things that we started in early 2024 was just I created a shared affiliate notebook because something people ask for was examples of how are people doing things and what do organizational formats look like and how are people doing entries?",
          "answer": "Like how can you create a template or a widget or things like that. So I made a notebook that anybody that's in a lab archives class with me now, I just add them to that notebook. And then we can start looking at it and use that as kind of a basis for making decisions down the road. So I try to do things like that where I find a place where maybe there's a way to build a resource that can scale up beyond me as one person and hopefully, and hopefully, start to be added to and used by a group of people. And so that's one space that I think at the medical library, we're doing a thing that is building towards improving data management just in that space. And just thinking about the lab staff as a population is something I really am interested in and just thinking about how to reach out to them. Okay. Thank you."
        },
        {
          "question": "I know we have your emails, I believe, at the end or a way to contact you at the end, but is that the best way to get started working with you?",
          "answer": "I'm just thinking from a very practical consideration. Yeah, typically for me, just sending me an email directly works. We also have like a shared reference account at the medical library. If you look up our contact info, it's Med-L-R-R-E-F is our shared email address. So anybody can always send messages there also. But yeah, looking me up is fine. Okay. Same for us. Email is great. We don't tend to use forms because every request is different. We do have a shared email data, D-A-T-A-S-E-R-V at I-U. It's in the slides at the end. And if you, that one is shared. So if one of us is out or in meetings, that may be a faster way to reach us. So we always encourage you to use that group account, but you can also copy our individual emails too. Sure. I'll ask Logan if she can put that slide up in just a minute, just for people to be able to grab that contact information. and we'll have it again at the end. She's also going to put up a set of slides because my next question is one that we prepared for, which was to ask you what kind of workshops, training sessions, or resources that you have. And you've already outlined a lot, but we actually, we know that you sent us some slides. So Logan, if you can share the slide with the folks for resources, well, I guess we can start with the university library. So this would be you, Heather. Yes. So all of our workshops are listed at the library's website, which is library. Indianapolis.I.U. They're also cross-posted in the Events.I.U catalog. We have something that we do that's not sort of relevant to this context is metrics workshops. But we have one data sharing workshop scheduled, I think, for a couple of weeks from now. Now that Corey's on board, she will be teaching work. workshops for students, we expect those to start getting scheduled in the fall. So I don't know if you want me to sort of speak to some of the other. I think we've already spoken to the information on that slide and I'll share this one when we get to that. Okay. And then if you wouldn't mind going to the Medical Library Data Classes slide, Logan. So Levi. Yeah, so on this slide I just listed the one-shot classes. that we can do regularly, and we also have a link there to where we have our classes listed. So, yeah, typically these are ones that we're dealing with specific NIH data management and sharing questions, and then we also have some data analysis classes. Our newest one is that generative AI for medical educators, and we're kind of introducing ways to think about prompting generative AI in a little bit more structured way, so people can move beyond just like playing around stage to doing some things where they have kind of some elements and techniques for how they want to do it. And yeah, we do, we are continually, I shouldn't say continually, but regularly adding to this list. And then I think was the, let's see, yes, so now I'm going to introduce our absent research data librarian today. This is Ethan Friedmanski, who unfortunately was ill today, was unable to join us. But Ethan works at I.U. Bloomington Libraries, and he works, well, he can help you with a number of different things in a very similar parallel vein to what Levi and Heather and Corey do in their respective libraries in Bloomington. He specifically wanted to highlight DataCorps, which is an institutional repository for open access data. You may not realize that IU has an institutional repository, but we do. And also, I'll plug some about the research data commons. We have a frequently asked questions set on our website that sort of explains why you might want to use an institutional repository or what type of institutional repository you might want to use what kind of choices. That was developed with Heather's help. So we really appreciate that because there are lots of choices when you get ready to share your data. He also is the contact point for IU ScholarWorks, which allows you to share open access articles, but also other types of literature, reports, other things as well. So I would encourage you to check that out. And if you have questions, and around Bloomington, he's the person of contact. He can generally do data management and data management plan consultations, general methods and data consultations as well. So you can see how to contact him. And I'm also going to, I had a note in the Q&A. We are very excited that there's going to be a new position opening up in I.U. Bloomington that is going to be the director of research data services. I'm a little cautious about naming who that person is. I know we had somebody in the group that said that they shared a little bit of this information with us, which, of course, I don't think she's actually still with us. So I can't call on her to speak. But I will say that we have somebody who is coming to join us and we are excited about this. This person is going to be working in partnership with Bloomington libraries, with the other libraries as well, with the research data commons to coordinate research data initiatives around campuses. So we've got additional capacity like we've had Corey join us. And I believe Levi's unit is also hiring some additional capacity in research data services as well. So this is a place where IU is making a lot of investments lately, needed investments. So I'm going to skip then to the next question that we have, which is, oh, excuse me, before I go back to my questions, I want to acknowledge we have a couple questions in the chat."
        },
        {
          "question": "And the first one was, how many databases does IU manage and what are they?",
          "answer": "And that's a really good question. Thank you, Nicole, for the question. The question is we don't have, at the moment, centralized data management, of databases specifically, although there are plenty of databases that people at the university do manage. However, this is something that will be changing in the future. We anticipate that the Research Data Commons is going to take on a suite of reusable and reshareable data sets at the university. So watch our space for more announcements about that in the months to come. You can find a small data catalog right now on the Research Data Commons website. under resources, you can find a data catalog. It has a few major data resources that are available for reuse at the time. Those are also going to be growing. That's been part of our mission at the Research Data Commons to be able to centrally manage, especially licensed or very large data sets that require centralized management of data use agreements or of security for access to resources. So I would point you to the research data commons section, and Logan has just put a link into our data catalog. We'll have a new, and we have a new version of this data catalog as well coming soon, and we'll have new content in the months to come. And then we hadn't, sure, go ahead, Heather. I was just going to add to that and say, so there's confusing terminology in library land. We call databases the access points where you get articles and books and all these. other things. So in case you meant library databases, there's the line between a database that has data in it that the library provides and the line between a database that provides access to journal articles or reports or books is pretty blurry at this point. So the library also purchases and licenses data that you can use. A good example of that is something called policy map. We also have local versions from the Polis Center. There's something called Savi, which is central Indiana oriented and it's information about the community. So one of the challenges with data is that the terminology is often vague and confusing. So when you're looking for data, there's maybe three different ways you could think about it. There's open data from the government. There's open data that's kind of floating around there on the web. Some of that stuff is in data repositories. And we have, librarians are good at sort of having a handle on where can you get to these data because right now it's not as well organized as some of our other things. It's all over the place. And then you have data that you have to pay for or you have to do some kind of legal contract. And so all of these are ways we get access to data that you might want to use for your research. And so just, I just want to acknowledge the language is confusing. So it's okay. Yeah, we appreciate it. Yes, so we're always happy to help you figure out what those things are. There are really great resources on the library that one could use as data, that are databases. And I think about, we were just talking about this earlier today about newspapers and how so many researchers use sort of text of newspapers as a data source for them and their research. But they are also, you know, we think of them in a lot of different ways. So thank you for your question there."
        },
        {
          "question": "Does anybody here have an answer to that?",
          "answer": "Because I certainly don't."
        },
        {
          "question": "Levi, do you?",
          "answer": "Well, I mean, there's not like a specific procedure that's required by IU research for what you would do in that case. Well, so we have some IU managed biorepositories, and the way they handle that is typically in, it's typically specific to the biorepository. So if you already have a contact, I would ask them. If you are looking for a place to put your data that's associated with the biorepository, I would also ask them because they may have infrastructure already set up. For example, I think PEDs has their own sort of pediatrics, I'm sorry, in the School of Medicine. has their own sort of infrastructure configured for their needs. It's going to vary, is my, I guess, answer to that. There are lots of options, but there isn't one answer for that, I think, that I'm aware. I'm just talking about the metadata that's associated with it, yes."
        },
        {
          "question": "Or even the data derived from the samples, right?",
          "answer": "Yes."
        },
        {
          "question": "What would you say is a first, like a good first place to ask?",
          "answer": "My inclination would be to send that person to the biorepository, folks who run the biorepository and ask them what the state, like what the standard metadata storage protocol is, if they have one or what are other people are doing in this case. Yeah, it will depend on the terms under which the data were collected, the samples were collected, and what permissions they were given by participants and the infrastructure. are set up, but so yes, talk to the biorepository representative. Yeah, okay. Okay, thank you."
        },
        {
          "question": "Are there books or websites or resources, et cetera?",
          "answer": "And I think Logan, I'm going to throw this to Heather because we flashed the screen earlier with one of the things that you said that you would like to share with folks. Yeah. So one of my favorite resources is a book called Data Management for Researchers. And it's relatively inexpensive. I think it's something like $20 something dollars. If you are not ready for a book length, it's maybe a couple hundred pages. But if you're a doctoral student, I would say invest in it. She has a PhD in optics. So she was a bench scientist. She's now a data librarian. If you have the time and you want to invest that in reading a book, that is the place I would start, if you don't have time, or maybe you're an undergraduate, we wrote an article together called foundational practices of research data management. It's open access. It's free. And it walks you through 10 sort of foundational practices for managing your data and points to some of the core literature. If you want hands-on practice exercises, Kristen wrote a workbook, also open access as are most of the things that we do. And you can get to that from the link on this site. It gives you some activities to actually implement good research data management practices into your projects. I think they're super helpful. I will just say that when we say research data management, it tends to skew towards. sciences and social sciences, humanists, artists, other kinds of researchers do this. They might just call it something different. And so if you're looking for guidance from that perspective, I also have some resources that I can point you to, but this tends to be applicable to a broader audience, which is why this is the one that I point people to. Thank you."
        },
        {
          "question": "to add?",
          "answer": "No, I think this is great. We did have one question that just popped in to ask if anybody here could speak about Red Cap, not too detailed, but a general overview of who uses it and how it's used."
        },
        {
          "question": "Levi, do you want to, or do you want me to?",
          "answer": "I mean, I guess usually what I would refer people to is the IU at Red Cap knowledge-based entry from UITs. So they do have a lot of recorded trainings on just getting you started with Red Cap. But as far as like who uses it, I don't know that there's a centralized way to answer that question, but definitely there are people in many different departments and groups that are using it. So I'll give an attempt. So Red Cap is, it was created of Vanderbilt. We have an instance here that's available to all of the Indiana CTSI partner, so IU, Purdue, Notre Dame. So if you collaborate with folks outside of IU, it's a really great resource. The main thing to know is it's built for structured data. So quantitative survey responses or questionnaires that where the data are relatively validated, it's not a good tool for qualitative research. But it actually has a number of extensions where you can build an app specific for your study and have participants submit data. So there's an extension called MyRED or MyCAP. That's what it's called. So it's a piece of our core infrastructure. It is approved for PHA, so personal health information and critical research data. So it's got a lot of security and controls around it. It's built from the perspective of, you know what your data should be organized as, and then you create the data collection instruments. So for some people, that can feel a little bit, reversed or backwards, but we have great support. So highly recommend you contact our Red Cap rep. I think it's still Catherine Martinez-Bauer. They know the system very well and provide lots of great trainings and one-on-one support. Thank you for that. That is a great. I was going to try to give an explanation, but it was not going to be as good. So thank you, Heather. I'm going to end with a question to each of you."
        },
        {
          "question": "If you could give one piece of advice to IE researchers about managing their data, what would it be?",
          "answer": "I'll start with you, Levi. One piece of advice, I would say, well, I'd say that the people I work with that are having difficulty in ways that infuriate them or are difficult for them or because they're thinking about research data management deep into their project, so for the first time. So my piece of advice would be start thinking about it before you've collected data, before you've submitted your grant, as you're designing how you want to set things up and what you need to learn, start thinking about research data, what the data is you will create, how much there will be, what it's going to look like as early as you can, and think about some time points during your project period for when things are likely to change, make some kind of outline. So even though things are going to change when you do the project, if you can think about it early, that will benefit you. You will maximize the benefits down the road. Yeah, so one of the requirements of putting in any, at this point, any federal grant application is to create a data management and sharing plan that is submitted at the time of, proposal, but you can create a data management and sharing plan at the beginning of any project. You don't actually need to be doing this for a proposal. And I think getting at what Levi is saying, it's not a bad thing to subject yourself to that process of writing it out at the beginning to make yourself more thoughtful. So that's a really good example."
        },
        {
          "question": "So Heather, do you have a single piece of a device?",
          "answer": "I have two. I'm going to cheat. That's fine. They're both short. So one is, just remember, you don't have to have all the expertise to figure out all the research data technological, compliance, security stuff, there's a massive infrastructure of support people and services and technology to help you. So ask for help. If you're not sure where to start, reach out to us. We're happy. We will point you in the right direction. The second one is, if you already are midway, and I learned this through personal experience a long time ago, and you don't have a plan. Start writing down what you're doing. Just create a word document, write down what you are doing, and think about whether it's working or not. And if it's not, talk to people who can help you either improve it or sit on it and come back to it. And if you have a document that describes what you're doing, you'll be miles ahead of people who don't write stuff down. Like documentation is 90% of research in my perspective because that record matters and it's not just the data that are enough you need the documentation to tell you and remind you how the data were created and what issues you noticed during data collection etc yeah um Corey oh it's going to be hard to add to add anything to that those are both really great advice um i will say coming from my past experience i would just also you know, talk about the importance of having backups for your data. So I've worked on projects where we had a data breach in the middle of it and lost access to servers. But thankfully, because we properly backed up our data, we were not, you know, left in a lurch in that. So backing up and having multiple different backups of data in different locations is also incredibly important to have. Okay. All right. Well, thank you all for joining. I would like to give anybody who's in the audience a last chance to ask a question. And I will also share, thank you, Logan, for sharing our information. So this is, we have both the contact information. So we have the data serve at IU, which is the general, the group account email for Heather and Corey, and also Levi's email here as well. But also, you're welcome to contact us at the Research Data Commons. because that is our job is to be a coordinating center and get you to the right people. And we really do appreciate our partners at the libraries for being always excellent sources of resources, and help, support, knowledge. They're always sharing a better way to do something, so we really appreciate that. So I don't see any questions that are popping up in the Q&A. So with that, I'm going to thank you all for joining us and also remind everybody else that's still here that they are welcome to come to any of our other topic discussions that we're going to be having, and all of those registrations are open right now. So thanks a lot. And thank you all for coming today. I appreciate it. Discovering Data Resources at IU Hi everyone, this is Anne McCranie. I'm with the Research Data Commons. I'm joined by Emily Meanwell and Logan Schuerman. We are going to do the introduction to research data resources here at the university for you today. So we'll get started right now."
        },
        {
          "question": "All right, are you able to see my screen?",
          "answer": "Excellent. Okay, thank you for joining us. So we are going to be sharing these slides with you here. You are welcome to, you can use the QR code, and Logan is actually going to put this URL in the chat for everyone so that you can download these slides. We encourage you to do that because, in fact, we'll be clicking through a lot of links that are in these slides, and you're welcome to do so during the webinar to see what we're talking about, as we mention a lot of materials. So when we do this introduction, this is a is two miles wide and three inches deep in terms of the resources that you have at the university. There are a lot of resources at IU for you, which is the great news. And the, so we can't definitely, we can't get into them all. So we're going to encourage you to take a look and then feel free to ask us questions in the Q&A function in the webinar, and we will be happy to try to answer those. We should have some time at the end to be able to answer individual questions as we go. So the first thing I'd like to tell you is that the IU Research Data Commons, we consider ourselves the front door to research data resources at university, at the university as a whole, so across all campuses. So we are a relatively new initiative of the vice president of research. And this is an office that's done in collaboration with the libraries and also with UITS and with other partners. Over this last year, we've launched a new website. at researchdata.I.U. So you're welcome to take a look at that. We're going to come back to the site several times during the webinar to show you different aspects of it. But that was one of our first sort of kickoff activities for this was try to organize as much as we could about research data resources at the university in one place for you to be able to discover answers to questions, for you to be able to discover new resources that you didn't know exist, and also just to serve as a space for folks to be able to collect this. because what we found is that there are a lot of, lot of resources that are coming from different parts of the university, but that was kind of hard to find them. One of the things that we maintain is an event listing as well. I'm going to show you some more about that. But this is a growing collection of materials, and you can help us. So as we are going through this webinar, if you think there are questions that we don't have answered, if you go through the website and you find things that you wish that you could find out more about, I'm going to show you how you can very easily send us more information. and we'll try to add to that. So we really like to take suggestions for new things that we can list, but also suggestions for questions that we can try to answer. So one of the very first things that we did was we developed a set of frequently asked questions that were around the topics of research data in general. And so you can see this listed on our front page of our website, but also here inside our frequently asked questions area. where we have our questions sort of organized into five different areas that sort of are around the lifecycle of data. So there's planning your research, acquiring data, policies and procedures, storage, compute, and analysis, and sharing and archiving. We're going to come back to a lot of these, but I just wanted to show you how the fact works. So if you come into one of the sections, such as acquiring data, you will see a list of questions, and then you can actually click on any of the ones that are available here. You'll see the other ones on your left-hand side. And you'll see a bit of text and most often what you'll see is a link to resources. If you'll notice there is a small green icon that says RC and that actually lists you to a that actually links you to there are resource data catalog. So this is another thing that we started collecting as we were creating these frequently asked questions and kind of trying to scrape the university for all the material that we could find about research data resources. We actually created a catalog of resources. So if you click on one of these, it will take you to our resources. This is our resource catalog. It's in development like the rest of our site, but it is active. And what you'll find is a quick explainer for what this resource actually is, and then a link that will take you quickly to the direct resource. And it'll tell you to what the scope of this resource is. So if you are from any one of the campuses, it'll tell you if this resource applies to you. Most of the resources that are in our data are in our resource catalog do apply to everyone that's within the university, but there are some campus specific resources. So you might want to check that. That resource catalog is searchable. We have a lot of different kinds of terms that are in there, but it will just re-tech search anything in there as well. So feel free to take a look around. And if you find a resource that you think is missing from there and you would like to see it listed, let us know. So another aspect of, as I just mentioned, this resource catalog, we are, like I said, we're trying to continue to build it. We have a lot of materials that's in here. One of the things that I think is really helpful about this is that we are keeping this up to date. So this is an ongoing project for us. It wasn't just to build this and have it sit and get old, but also to keep it constantly up to date. So we would also be happy if you reported bad links to us or other things because we are striving to keep that going, even as situations can be pretty fluid. We also have another resource on our website called the Featured Data Program. And this is a set of canvas courses that we've developed and some more are to come that are, allow you to see how you could actually use some pretty high value, large reusable data sets that the university has access to. These really vary in the where they come from and sort of what the purpose of them is. Some of them are pretty highly regulated and have a lot of security around them. Some are more public access data sets that you can get, you can get, you can get, you know, hands on and start working with. But these are all self-paced tutorials that we encourage you to take a look at. And like I said, we will be developing more of these over time, and we'll have an expand set of courses that you can link to and see what all we have. So we would welcome you to join those. And you can just essentially click these and you can self-enroll yourself in any of these canvas courses. We also strive to maintain an up-to-date listing of all of the research data or data-related events that we can find around the IU campuses. So some of these are going to be in-person events that are on specific campus. They may not be your campus. It may not be easy to go to. But what we're finding is a lot of them are hybrid or virtual events as well that are often open to anyone. So if we find something that we feel it can be useful or shared, we're going to share it. So these are across all units. So we have our own events, but these are events that are coming from other places. So we really try to curate as much as we can find and share here. So again, from your own unit, if you learn of something that you think would be worthy of being shared here or useful or interesting to other folks, let us know because we try to amplify events that are of interest across the university campuses. We also, to that end, maintain a monthly newsletter that we send out, which you are all encouraged and welcome to join. We do not spam. We send a monthly update. We do our very best to never send anything off schedule because we know we all get email fatigue. But one of the reasons that we do this is because there is a lot going on at IU and there is a lot of news and there also are new resources that come online. And this is a good way to be among the first to learn about that. So you might have heard about our research data or spring series and this is the kickoff for our spring series of events through a mailing through IU research. We don't get many of those mailings very often. We're very glad when we do, but this is one of our main methods of communication. So visiting our website, checking out our events, and joining our newsletter are really the ways to stay in touch with us and stay, you know, in contact. So I'm going to stop right now and see if we have any questions that we can answer in the moment. And then I'm also going to launch a poll while we're seeing if there are any questions that we can answer. The poll is a very short one. It's basically just going to ask you where you're from. And let me see if I can get this one going. There. Okay. So it should be running right now. So we'll ask you to just give us a moment and answer these four questions about where you're from, what your status is at the university. And it just really helps us to understand where people are coming from. And then I'm going to look in the chat to see if there are any questions."
        },
        {
          "question": "Logan or Emily, do you guys see anything that we need to answer right now?",
          "answer": "Oh, yes, I see the recordings will be available. Thank you, Diane. And we have a website of all of our previous recordings and all of our events that we do in a virtual context will be recorded and available along with their slides. We'd love for you to be people to come back and look at them afterwards. That's part of the point of this. Great. So I think our responses have slowed down. So I'm going to end the poll. Oh, wait. Take a moment. Have a few more coming in. Okay. Well, thank you all for responding. I'm going to share the results just so that you can see most of our participants today are coming from Indianapolis, but we do have a fair number from Bloomington, and we're also happy to see some colleagues from East and Fort Wayne. Oh, and South Bend and Southeast. Now I'm flipping all the way down. So we have a lot of faculty here today, but we also have staff and graduate students as well. So welcome to everyone. We're really happy to see you here. And most of you are actually not new to IU. So it's good to hear that as well. So we hope that this is, we'll still provide you with new information. Okay. So the first main set of resources outside of what the RDC itself is doing that we're gonna highlight are coming from the libraries. So just one second. So the, we have a lot of different resources the libraries and I'm going to go over some, but one of the main sets of resources that we have the libraries are literally our people that are there, our research librarians. So we have, we actually have four research librarians now. We had three up until just recently. Corey Barber has joined the IUI library staff, but we have research data librarians who have been around for quite a while and are great resources for you, especially on your specific campuses. So Heather Coates is with the university libraries in Indianapolis. Levi Dolan is with Ruth Lilly Medical Library, and Ethan Friedmansky is at the I.U. Bloomington Libraries as well. So you, if you are at one of the campuses that is not one of these three, your librarians are probably going to be subject librarians, and that is fine to go to them as well. But if you have specific questions about research data and resources, you might also come and approach some of these librarians as well. It is our observation, our librarians are very, very helpful and they want to reach and help everybody from within the university community. So don't be hesitant to reach out."
        },
        {
          "question": "Speaking of our fantastic research data librarians next week on, I believe it's Tuesday, right?",
          "answer": "I'm going to look for some feedback. Okay, so Tuesday of next week, we're going to have an event where you can actually come and meet our research data librarians. We're going to ask them about the kind of work that they do with people, how you can actually engage with them."
        },
        {
          "question": "And, you know, what are, what are things they'd like for you to know about resources that are available for you at the libraries?",
          "answer": "Librarians are the best, so we're excited to have them come and join us. The, I wanted to mention in particular, Heather Coates, who is, are not only the research data librarian at the, in Indianapolis at the university libraries, but is also in a service position for the university as a whole is the IU research data steward. And what this means, it can mean if you have any kind of data that has any kind of complicated classification, if you have a question about data classification and you need an official ruling, if you need help with figuring out how you can work with different offices specifically about research data, Heather is a main point of contact and can assist you. And you will find her name on many, many different slides or you'll find things that leaked to her on many slides because she knows a lot. So we've actually had Heather attend these events before, and I always feel strange saying this about her, but she is really a font of information. We're glad that she has a colleague now, Collie Barber, who Corey Barber has joined her because we're excited for her to have some help in all of this. But she does serve the specific purpose of being the data steward, and thus is an expert in these particular issues. So we want to encourage you if you have questions about data classification, we're going to show you a couple of tools about figuring some of these data classification issues out. We're going to talk a little bit about why this is an issue that you need to care about. But if you have questions, we're happy to help, but chances are, we're going to be going to Heather and asking her for more specific expertise. So speaking of one of the tools that you can use, one of the links that is here, and I think you may find it in some other spots in our presentation because it's pretty important is the data storage and handling tools. So I'm going to click on this to show you what this is. This is held by the data storage, the data management data storage council website. And it is a tool that allows you to search for the type of data that you have and the way that it would be classified. What we at the research data commons are focusing on is primarily research data. And we'll talk more about this. as well, but research data is considered institutional data at the university and thus is under the same sets of rules as all the other data. It may have some specific rules based on the kind of data it is, but it is a kind. But you can see that a lot of this data storage handling tool was developed thinking about what we might think of more as institutional data in the more classic sense of having been created by the institution of IU. And then it's data about our you know, international students that we have, enrollment, you know, data about research at the university, that sort of thing. But specifically, what we're focused on is research data itself. So this is the data that you as a researcher might be bringing in from outside. So you would select research data as the type that you have. And you would find out that the default classification for research data is restricted."
        },
        {
          "question": "What does that mean?",
          "answer": "We're going to talk a little bit more about that, but that you would actually find out what the rules were about what you can actually do with restricted data, where you can actually use it, how you can actually see what is not restricted versus restricted, what are the restrictions on you in order to be able to use your data. That is not to say that all data is, all research data is restricted. That's just the assumption of research data when you start. So we'll get into more of this. There are definitely cases in which your research data may be public data. Definitely, there are situations in which your data may be critical, and it may have more, may have more restrictions on it than what we would expect. So from that. So we'll come back to some of this. But this is a very helpful, I think, resource for everyone to know and for you to understand about how your research data is classified is pretty important. One of the sets of questions that we have in our frequently asked questions is actually about sharing and archiving your data. So if you think about the life cycle of data, there's the collection of the data, the acquiring of it early on, there's actually working with it when you analyze. But often at the end, you want to actually share and archive your data for future use or for your own publication, for replication, that sort of thing. And so there are a lot of, you know, you have a lot of choices when you do that. You may have your choices constrained if you are, for instance, being funded by a particular agency that has a particular way of requiring you to share data, then you have to go with that. But if not, you might have some other choices. Maybe your journal has some recommendations for you. Maybe there's a disciplinary or a specific kind of data repository. And those are actually usually the first choices for depositing your data. But beyond that, there are also generalist or institutional data repositories that are available to you. There are things that are available to you as IU researchers that you can use, that give you long-term, if not permanent data storage. And then, of course, there are generalist and specialist and repositories that are out there in the world. This heuristic, but also this frequently asked question that's linked here, can give you some ideas and best practices for how you actually share data. And there's more. This group of folks, a particular research data librarians, have several guides on how you can share and how you can make your data available for public use. There are a lot of different library resources, and I'm not going to click on all of these links, but I encourage you to, if you find something that really interests you. One of the links, though, that I do want to click on is a managing and sharing research data guide that was actually authored by Heather Coates, as we've said, that is on the University Library site that actually gives you good guidance for how you should manage and store your data and share it. And so I would encourage you to take look at that. There's also an interesting guide here that I didn't know existed. Maybe many of you did about new electronic resources that are available at the university, which is through the libraries. And again, some of these are Bloomington specific, but many of these are system-wide. And you can actually come in and look and see what has actually been acquired at the university that I could get access to. So these are kind of fun to click through. We found this as our process. So anyway, Anyway, these are sometimes, you know, library acquisitions do serve as data for researchers. So we encourage you to see what your library has been collecting. We did link to the data management, excuse me, we did link talk about the data storage and handling tool. There is another tool that is available to you through our libraries called the data management plan tool. if you are writing proposals and you need help with writing a data storage and management plan for an NIH or an NSF or even any other type of proposal that's asking you for that, there is a tool that the university has sort of signed us up for called the DMP tool that you can link to here. And it can help you. It sets you through a list of guided questions that help you create a compliant form for different types of funding agencies, particularly federal funding agencies. So that's a good resource for you. Scholarworks is a good way for you to be able to collect, to be able to store sort of associated products of research, maybe not your data, but, you know, publications that you might have or metadata that's attached to it. You might have do files or scripts that you need to upload and have a secure place to store, along with getting a permanent identifier, a D.O. that can be linked to it for whatever purpose for your funder or elsewhere. So you have access to those at IU. Okay, so the next set of major resources that we have are coming from information technology. And of course, this is one of the crown jewels of IU is a rich set of information technology resources that we have. And specifically, we have a pretty large division of UITS that is devoted to research technologies. And so the UITS research technologies group offers access, training, and support for a wide variety of research needs. And they will work with everyone. They do primarily service faculty needs, but the things that they offer benefit many different folks around the university. And it's not surprising to hear them talk of working with when they need two graduate students with specialized computer computing needs. They serve everyone, basically, at the University. So it's a leave no stone unturned for this. But they work specifically with about 1,800 different resources here, excuse me, researchers here faculty who use supercomputers or other high performance computing tools. One of the things that Uitts does provide, and I wanted to draw this to your attention if you have never seen it, they have tech guides. And these tech guides can be useful for you and they have sort of personalized them or, you know, made them relevant for faculty staff, students, and collaborators. And this collaborator's guide can be very helpful if you're a faculty member who is working with somebody who is not at IU but needs to get a IU computing account in order to work with you together. This guide can help them understand what they can and can't do. If there are any rules, they're going to have things that they have to, you know, agree to in order to have this, but this is a good guide for them to be able to understand what their, what services are available to them and what are not. The other thing that we want to point out is what was formerly known as the knowledge base is now service now knowledge. It is, I don't think many of us could have been at the university for very long without encountering this knowledge base and how you can actually find out where you're going in the university or how you're actually accessing certain resources. So many of our resources that we link to through the research, data commons are drawn from ServiceNow records, and they will link back to that as a source. ServiceNow has a pretty strict editing and sort of editorial control over the content that's there. It really is a huge resource that the university has. One of the things that you can do is actually use consultation services. I should have mentioned this with the librarians because there's also ask a librarian service, which is also super helpful. Well, you can also ask research technologies for assistance. So they have a form. You can get in touch with them and somebody will get back to you and kind of get you to the right folks. They have a lot of online materials. They have some IT training that's going on. There's some, I believe this may still be going on right now. There's practical coding for researchers that's coming up and there'll be a couple of sessions of that. Their stuff is also recorded and a lot of material available. So I would encourage you to take a look at research technologies and see whether or not they are useful for you. But there's lots of different groups that work within research technologies that have different capabilities. And we have lots of compute resources at the university as well. And if you were already doing this sort of work, then you know this quite well. but you may not realize how much you have access to and how you are largely with no charge back to you individually or to your department. So we'd encourage you to take a look at it and see if it refers, if it first is the sort of work that you need to do and your needs. I also want to mention the Pervasive Technology Institute, which has several centers that are within it that work with researchers. But two in particular, the Data to Insight Center often collaborates with faculty, especially for, you know, specific project areas with getting there with respect to data science and data science outreach. And we also have the Hothi Trust Research Center, which is IU has been a part of this. It has run, I believe it's still run out of the University of Michigan right now. And it has a very large collection, digital collection of text corpus that you have access to you. So I encourage you to take a look at this as well. So this is a particular helpful for researchers in the humanities who are interested in the types of materials that they have there. And now I'm going to turn over to Logan, who is going to talk to us about the services and offerings that IU Research has. Thank you. And if we want to go to the next slide, we can see some of the support that IU Research has available. This is your go-to place for policy and information related to working with research data. It also houses a number of research institutes and or sorry, yeah, sorry, research institutes as well as housing information about research compliance. And so if we want to go to the next slide, I'll kind of highlight some of the major offerings. There, like I said, are a number of compliance resources available. You can also find consultations for proposal development, grant writing. You can see a list of training and events that has workshops that are coming up, as well as some internal seed funding programs. And I want to highlight today the Reds program because it is new, and that is the research and evaluation design support for grant proposals. And this program provides specialized consultation related to research design, evaluation plans, survey methodology, and statistics. And it leverages the expertise of the Institute for Social and Behavioral Research Centers and programs. And this is something that is available to faculty PIs or co-PIs who are applying for external grants at no cost to you. And I do want to note that some of these services such as Reds and the consultation services, proposal development services and research development services are specifically available to faculty. But I know we have graduate students joining us today. And so I want to acknowledge that, but also share that there are other support options available through the graduate school and graduate student government. So I highly recommend you look there for some additional resources. And then like I've mentioned a couple times. If we want to go to the next slide, I'm going to talk about some of those policies and compliance that I have been referencing. And if we go to the next slide after that, I'm just going to talk about a couple specific policies today because they're a little bit lesser known. The first one is that research data is institutional data. And so that means that, and Ann kind of touched on this earlier, so I'm just going to touch on it briefly. But your research data should be managed in the same ways as institutional data. And there are, of course, occasionally some exceptions to this rule. So sometimes a sponsor may assert ownership over the data. And in that case, it will likely be included in the contract. Of course, then public data is not owned by IU. It is not institutional data, but it is still a best practice to treat it in the same way as institutional data because that helps you to maintain the integrity of your research. And then if we go to the next slide, I want to talk about a best practice. We're all very frequently asked to sign terms and conditions. But if you are operating in official capacity when working for IU, then it's a best practice to send a contract or agreement to the office for research administration because there is someone with expertise in contracts who can review at first. At times, you as the PI may be the appropriate person to sign a contract. However, other times a fiscal officer or other department may need to be the signing entity, and so they can help make sure that the correct person is signing. And even if you as a PI are the person signing, having someone review it can just make sure that they are going over the terms in the contract and that there's nothing concerning or that needs to be otherwise addressed. And so you can do this by sending the contract, filling out the ORA contract request form and sending them the terms or agreements or the contract and someone will review it and work with you on that. So those are just a couple policies that are relevant to research data. And then those are, of course, not even close to all of the policies. that you need to follow. And so this is just a list of some go-to resources for more informational various policies from data management to data security. And of course, the RDC website, the Policies and Procedures section is a centralized place where you can find more of this information. And now I'm going to turn things over to Emily to talk about planning research. Thanks so much, Logan. Thanks to everybody for being here. I think so far we've touched on a lot of the resources across different units on campus. And so now we wanted to look at a couple of those stages of the research data lifecycle and highlight some key resources too. So for planning research, we have lots of resources that can help you if you're at this stage. We've already told you about our frequently asked questions. So you can click on planning research and see a list of all of the kinds of of questions and answers that we have there. You can also search for resources in the resource catalog. Here's an example of all of the different things we have in our planning research frequently asked questions. If you can't find the answer to your question, there's a nice little box where you can put in the question that you would like to be answered and somebody can respond to you and or also add it to our website. So these are great for planning research. We also have specific resources in the resource catalog. So that's another place to look. So for example, if you want to consult about some topic, you can type consult into the text box and you'll see all of the different groups that provide consulting services. You can also filter by campus and so on and so forth. And then I'll talk about this a little more in the next section. But if you look at the data catalog and or through some repositories, you might also be able to find some data sets that are already available to you at IU, which could be helpful in the planning stages too. The next slide just has a screenshot of one of the planning research frequently asked questions, that one of the more general ones, I want to plan a research product about X topic, who can help me plan that. And then the next slide after that has some additional sample resources that might be helpful to you at this stage. So resources for compliance a little bit, like what Logan was just talking about, general support for grant proposals as well. Yeah, so that's the research compliance page. Proposal development services helps faculty prepare proposals. The slide also mentions the grad grant center. So that's a great place if you're a graduate student to get help preparing proposals as well. There's also a lot of more specific support available through a lot of different service centers and research cores on campus. So things like power analyses, evaluation plans. You can find these things through the frequently asked questions or search the resource catalog as well. The next slide also just has a couple of sample resources specifically for data management. This is often, you know, often a great time to think about your data management planning is when you are in fact planning your research. So Anna is now scrolling through the research data management guidance, which has lots of information. And then also she previously mentioned the DMP tool that can help you write a data management plan, especially if you're applying for grant funding. So those are all resources from all of our different partners or from all around IU that can help with the planning stage. I also wanted to talk a little bit about acquiring data specifically. So again, we have frequently asked questions."
        },
        {
          "question": "how do I get data?",
          "answer": "So this could be purchasing data. It could be signing an agreement to get data from a vendor that you don't actually have to pay for, but you do need to fill out some paperwork. It could also be collecting your own data. The frequently asked questions is really nice because it sort of breaks down where you need to go, depending on how exactly you're acquiring that data, whether it's purchasing or the Office of Research Administration. You can also go to our data catalog, which is still in development and find out a little bit about data that's already available to you for reuse, especially at IU. So a lot of these are things, some of them are things that are available to everyone, like the HADY Trust Research Center, are available to consortia of university. This is an example H-Cup of a data set that researchers at IU have licensed, and we're able to share it with other researchers for reuse. And so you can find out if somebody else on campus already has those data and has been willing to help us make it available to other researchers. And you will see that I am in fact the public contact for HCups. If you have a question about that, you can email me specifically. And also briefly clicked on this. You can also pursue internal funding through the IU Research Equipment Fund to support the purchase of shared data resources. So this would often be something that a bunch of different research teams can use. And we highlight that in part just because we want to make sure that people know that data sets are considered research equipment and are eligible for that program too. All right. And then the next slide mentions a new resource that will be coming sometime in 2025 in Morrison Hall in Bloomington. But it is open to researchers across all campuses. You just have to come visit us in Bloomington. This This provides access to restricted use microdata from different federal agencies. It requires an application process, project approval, and a security clearance. You can browse some of the available data at researchdataGov.org. And I'd also be happy to talk about this more as well. So it's basically a highly secure facility where after you get those approvals, you can securely analyze these different data resources that might give you access to more detailed information, about geography or more specific information that is available in the public release versions of some of these data sets. So things like data sets from the National Center for Health Statistics, sometimes we'll have additional variables or additional levels of geographic detail in the versions available through this facility. All right. And then we have some resources on our slides about specifically related to storage and compute. Many of which are coming from our partners at UITS. So again, just to kind of reiterate, there's a whole series of frequently asked questions related to storage and compute and analysis. You can also find many of them in the resource catalog. And I do think we'll highlight some in a little bit, events coming up that relate to high-performance computing and data analysis techniques as well."
        },
        {
          "question": "The next slide just has a screenshot of one example of a frequently asked question, you know, what options for data storage are available?",
          "answer": "to I.E. Researchers and showed you a slide with a list of all of the different things or many of the different HPC resources, this might help you figure out if you're not sure where the best place is to store your data, this could be a place to start. The next slide also has a little more information on other tools that can help you figure out where might make sense to store your data. So the data sharing and handling tool in already mentioned. There's also the data storage finder, which helps you filter and control. compare different storage options. And then the Secure My Research Cookbook as well, which is designed as a cookbook with different recipes. So it will help you put in some task that you want to accomplish something that you want to cook. And we'll show you how to do that securely with your research data. Let's see. There is also... I'm sorry, something happened to the slideshow."
        },
        {
          "question": "Am I on the right slide for you, Emily?",
          "answer": "I think that you're on the Secure My Research Cookbook. Now you are on the slide that I was going to talk about. Yes. So Secure My Research is one resource that we wanted to highlight specifically. They are helpful at all stages, I would say, from planning to wrapping up your research project. They provide consulting and resources beyond their cookbook. They also will meet with you to help you make sure that you're complying with cyber security requirements and your grants, with IU policy, figuring out how to do your research and keeping everything secure. So I consult with them personally all the time. I send people to them all the time. They've helped me figure out how to set up some secure workflows to accomplish what I need to accomplish without breaking university rules and making sure that my data are kept secure. And actually, there's a question that I realize probably isn't visible to everyone that was sent to us in the chat."
        },
        {
          "question": "are there legal resources for writing or reviewing data use agreements?",
          "answer": "And the resource, I'm reading a comment that was already sent, the resource is actually probably the Office of Research Administration. They are the ones that would help you set up a data use agreement, get things signed, and so on and so forth. They've reviewed things for me as well. So that's another thing to know about. depending on exactly what your needs are, they're probably a good place to start. Let's see. And Emily, we have a hand raised, which I think we have time to take right now."
        },
        {
          "question": "Are you okay with us taking questions?",
          "answer": "Absolutely, yes. If I can, I'm going to allow you to unmute if you would like to speak. You may not have intended to raise your hand. So you're welcome to ask a question in Q&A. We'll come back to this a little bit later. So, okay, so I'm sorry, I apologize for interrupting here because something happened with my ability to move forward on the slideshow and now that little red dot is showing up. So I'll proceed on to the next slides. I think that we're going to turn things back over to Logan now to talk a little bit about some of those specific training opportunities. All right, so if we want to move to the next slide, as we have mentioned, I think a couple times today. This webinar today is the first in a spring series hosted by the Research Data Commons. And you can see the full schedule. It's on this slide. It's also on our website so you can refer back to it. And while today's webinar has been a mostly broad overview of existing resources and kind of where and how to find them, the remaining webinars are more of a deeper dive into specific topics. And so each webinar will be either a moderated conversation or a presentation with subject area experts who are going to focus on each of the topics that are listed. And all of the webinars will be recorded and posted on our website. So you're welcome to attend and come back and review later or if the timing doesn't work for you that will still be available. As Ann mentioned at the beginning, if you signed up for our newsletter, that's the best way to stay up to date with the events and when resources are posted on our website. And you can go to these links for each of these events and register for anything that may be of interest to you or if you just want reminders about it to come back to the recording later, you can sign up. And then the other half of this slide just shows some general resources on, I get, I know we went over a lot today, and so there may be a lot you want to come back to later, or maybe some specific things piqued your interest, and you want to know where you can find out more. And these are just some general areas of where you can find events and training opportunities to get more specialized information on various topics related to research data. And that concludes our webinar today, but we do. have some time for Q&A. So we'll stick around for a little bit and we're happy if you have questions if you want to put them in the chat or unmute and ask us. We are happy to answer your questions. Yeah, if you would like to raise your hand, we're happy to give you the ability to unmute and you are welcome to ask us questions directly or Q&A either way. Okay, well, I don't see anything. Oh, I see something in the chat. Oh, thanks, thanks Levi. One of our research data librarians was in the galley. So we are, we will end this. We're going to stop the recording here, but we will hang on for a few minutes if you want to try to catch us and ask a question unless we have any that are up. So we're asking if it's possible to get the web links via email."

          "question": "So you can actually download this set of slides immediately?",
          "answer": "So they're already available. And then in the next day or so, this recording will be up along with a link to the slides. And that's what we're trying to do with all of our materials, is have it available for you to download and review later. So you're always welcome to do that. You're also welcome to reuse whatever you find there. So we're happy to reshare."
